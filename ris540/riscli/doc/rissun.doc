Steps to install and run RIS on Sun SparcStations
################################################################################

The following steps have to be followed to install and run RIS.

NOTE: If you have products like exnuc, step 1 would have already been done.
      Skip to step 2.

1) Reconfigure the Kernel:

    a) Most of the SUNs usually come with a small kernel. It does not
    include the options to run Semaphores, Shared Memory, and Message
    Queues. Therefore you must go into the /usr/kvm/sys/sun4c/conf
    directory and edit the the kernel file <FILE>. Usually it is GENERIC_SMALL
    (You can make sure by typing "showrev"). Uncomment the following
    lines :
    #options IPCMESSAGE      # System V IPC message facility
    #options IPCSEMAPHORE    # System V IPC semaphore facility
    #options IPCSHMEM        # System V IPC shared-memory facility

    b) Run "config FILE"

    c) cd ../FILE

    d) make

    e) mv /vmunix /vmunix.orig

    f) cp vmunix /vmunix

    g) #/etc/halt
       > b

2) The following products/system configuration is assumed on the SUN:

    /bin/ksh

    SunOS 4.1.2/OpenWindows 3.0 (preferred)
        or
    SunOS 4.1.1/OpenWindows 2.0

    SUNCC (Sun Ansi C compiler)
    This is the default compiler for the RIS Sun/Sparc Development Platform.
    Standard cc or GNU gcc compiler may be invoked through riscpp flags.

    XFORMSRT and FONTSERVE
    The xrisschema_mgr link with the libraries provided by these two products.

3)  Default window size assumed is 35x80. For other sizes, set the
    environment variables LINES and COLUMNS appropriately.

4) RIS on the Sun will not have links going from <file_system>/ip32/ris/bin
   <file_system>/ip32/ris/lib etc. to the corresponding directories in the
   individual products. The executables and libraries will have to accessed
   from these products directly.

5) If you dont like the title bar coming up while running xrisschema_mgr,
   add the following entry to your .Xdefaults file (If you are running MOTIF):

   Mwm*Forms*clientDecoration:     resizeH

   "resizeH" gives you a minimum border. "none" would give you no border.
