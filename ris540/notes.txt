Just browsed around a bit.  Was wondering about being able to rebuild ris.a
partly to trouble shoot the blobs stuff and partly to make a .so library.

This looks like the actual source code.  

The public interface stuff appears to live in risapp/dload.

It's implemented in risapp/intrface

The master include files are in riscom.

No .y files.

Keys on unix quite a bit.

RIS_SERVER is also common.

Lot's of NT code.

Nothing else so far.

It uses .m files alone with a few new options.
