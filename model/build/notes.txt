Fresh checkout of model
Clean target

model_dirlist.sh

follow makeslic.sh manually

cd $MODEL/config/english/messages/src
make -rk

Have several cases where get a _huge_val error from omcpp
Putting if/endif around initial comments fixes it.

Have another case where unix_include was causing stdio.h to fail.
Removing it fixed it.

However have another case where unix_include/isl/values.h was required
MAXINT was not getting defined properly using /usr/include/values.h
Reverted to using unix_include but don't really like it.

Hplot does not link properly but ok for now.
