ATTENTION:

The files in this directory or any directories below are the the direct
result of X_forms fixes that could not be incorporated into an X_forms
build before the release of the EMS product.  In the case the X_forms is
rebuilt with the fixes included within, the appropriate files should be 
removed from that version of the EMS product dloadable directories.  Until
that time these files should be compiled for dload relocation in the 
$PRODUCT/config/dload/patch directory.
