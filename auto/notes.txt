Installed Suse 11.3 on a VM.

Use this auto directory to revisit the gnu make system.

Created C project, insidted on makefile or configure

Copy/paste files not working, very sad.

Removed nb 6.8 and installed 6.9 from netbeans.org

Set svn directory

Seems to work.  Even the debugger is somewhat useful.

Got a basic configure scenerio to work.  Need to check everything in and blow away.

Had to manually link /usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so

For Avondale want to control these libraries.  The delivered solaris 10 glib is too old for my uses.
Plus we don't want them changing unexpectdly.
Add LDFLAGS="-R/opt/ingr/lib -L/opt/ingr/lib"
lrwxrwxrwx 1 impd users     23 2010-12-05 06:33 libglib-2.0.so -> libglib-2.0.so.0.2400.1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 impd users     23 2010-12-05 06:33 libglib-2.0.so.0 -> libglib-2.0.so.0.2400.1
-rwxr-xr-x 1 impd users 936564 2010-12-05 06:32 libglib-2.0.so.0.2400.1

The linker uses -lglib-2.0 to find libglib-2.0.so
It pulls version number 0 out.
Then the run time will look for: libglib-2.0.so.0
The actual produced file is libglib-2.0.so.0.2400.1

Hence the triplet.
