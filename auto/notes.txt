Installed Suse 11.3 on a VM.

Use this auto directory to revisit the gnu make system.

Created C project, insidted on makefile or configure

Copy/paste files not working, very sad.

Removed nb 6.8 and installed 6.9 from netbeans.org

Set svn directory

Seems to work.  Even the debugger is somewhat useful.

Got a basic configure scenerio to work.  Need to check everything in and blow away.

Had to manually link /usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so
