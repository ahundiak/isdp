#  File describing how to make the drawing extraction for SMAN.
#
#  Currently, only the compartment can be extracted.
#
#  Notes:
#
#    If you want to extract compartments, do not forget to add to the 
#    DrawingTable file the compartment description. For instance:
#   
#drawing_comp of SMcomp
#{
# volume    model
# tightness model
#}
#
#
#  The extracted objects of a compartment can be:
#
#		- A composite curve (Contour): which is the intersection
#		  between the compartment volume and the drawing plane.
#
#		- A plane: which is made from the contour.
#
#		- A point (Cog). which is the projected center of gravity
#		  of the compartment on the drawing plane.
#	
#		- A name: which is the name of the compartment which is
#		  projected on the drawing plane.
#
#  The user can extract either cross-section of the compartment or projection 
#  of floors of compartment by specifying the option EXTRACT_TYPE. By default
#  cross-section of the compartments is extracted.
#
#
#  The user can ask the extraction of one or more than one objects depending
#  on the result he wants. For instance the "plane" representation can be
#  used with the shading mode.
#
#  For each kind of object, it is possible to redefine the symbology (level,
#  color, weight, style). Mainly three options are available:
#
#		- Active: use the active one.
#
#		- Object: take the same has the compartment.
#
#		- User: it is user defined.
#
#
#  For the extraction of the names, the following two more options exist.
#           1.  Text justification which can be:
#
#		-  LEFT_BOTTOM  
#		-  LEFT_BASE    
#		-  LEFT_CENTER  
#		-  LEFT_CAP     
#		-  LEFT_TOP     
#
#		-  CENTER_BOTTOM
#		-  CENTER_BASE  
#		-  CENTER_CENTER
#		-  CENTER_CAP   
#		-  CENTER_TOP   
#
#		-  RIGHT_BOTTOM 
#		-  RIGHT_BASE   
#		-  RIGHT_CENTER 
#		-  RIGHT_CAP    
#		-  RIGHT_TOP    
#
#	    2.  Attribute of the compartment which will be displayed as label of
#		the compartment. The attribute can be one of the following :
#	        - name       -> compartment name will be displayed
#		- descript   -> description of the compatment will be displayed
#		- class	     -> class
#		- comp_num   -> text stored in comp_num will be displayed
#		Default is "name".
#
#  For the extraction of the contour, there is one more option which is
#  the capability of adding extra short line at contour break points. These
#  short lines can have a length which is either computed by the system
#  or which is defined by the user or which has to be longer than a
#  minimum and shorter than a maximum.
#
#
#
#  The way of defining something is: By default nothing is done or the 
#  active symbology will be used.
#      
#  The key-words are:
#
#  COMPARTMENT      means that the following is for compartments.
#
#  EXTRACT_TYPE	    means that the following specifies extraction type.
#
#  EXTRACT	    means that the specified will be extracted. Can be
#		    either CROSS_SECTION or FLOOR. 
#
#  CROSS_SECTION    option for EXTRACT
#
#  FLOOR	    option for EXTRACT
#
#  CONTOUR	    means that contours will be extracted.
#
#  PLANE	    means that planes will be extracted.
#
#  COG		    means that center of gravity points will be extracted.
#
#  NAME		    means that compartment names will be extracted.
#
#  LEVEL	    means redefinition of the level follow.
#
#  COLOR	    means redefinition of the color follow.
#
#  WEIGHT	    means redefinition of the weight follow.
#
#  STYLE	    means redefinition of the style follow.
#
#  OBJECT	    means use the definition of the extracted compartment.
#
#  JUSTIF	    for compart. name, means redefinition of the justif.
#
#  ATTRIBUTE	    for compart. name, this attribute of compartment will
#		    be displayed as name of compart.
#
#  LINE		    for contour, means adds short lines. (not yet implemented)
#
#  MIN_LENGTH_LINE  when LINE, means minimum distance. ( not yet implemented )
#
#  MAX_LENGTH_LINE  when LINE, means maximum distance. ( not yet implemented )
#
#  LENGTH_LINE      when LINE, means that the distance is fixed. 
#			( not yet implemented )
#
#
#  The following is an example. Extract all contour, name, Plane & cog.
# Extract cross-section of comaprtments. Description of the compartment
# is the label to be displayed. The text justification will be centered
# around the cog of the compartment. Active values of level, color, 
# weight and style are used if not specified.
