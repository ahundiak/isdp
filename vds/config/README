Product:        I_VDS           Intergraph Vehicle Design System
Number:         SM01096
Description:    The Intergraph Vehicle Design System (I/VDS) is a computer-
                aided engineering (MCAE) product that provides a ship or
                airframe design environment. I/VDS works in conjunction with
                the design capabilities of the Intergraph/Engineering Modeling
                System to construct three-dimensional compartment models used
                in designing structural features (hull units, bulkheads, and
                superstructure molded surfaces) and shipboard/airborne
                equipment (galley and berthing equipment, machinery, office
                furniture, lavatory facilities, etc.) I/VDS is integrated
                with all other I/EMS-based applications, allowing complete
                ship or airframe model definition (including structural and
                distributive system design).

Product File Description
------------------------

	The Intergraph Vehicle Design System (I/VDS) is using predefined
	or user defined ASCII files, with allows to enter information for
	the model or for the support modeling.


	The following ASCII files are predefined in I/VDS. (The corresponding
	command or command object, plus a short description are given.


	--------	-----------------------------------------------------
	Filename:	Description:
