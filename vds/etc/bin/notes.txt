1. Using $RIS/bin/riscpp

2. Track down this size attribute long

typedef int more_aligned_int __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));

// This should align
typedef double double8 __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));

Seems to work.  All og th BS routines use IGRdouble so:
typedef double IGRdouble __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));

opp does not like long double
doubt if it really matters
might try messing around with the structure and see what happens
"/usr/include/sys/types.h", line 207:warning: size attribute long already declared - ignored.

4. figure out what %safe does
