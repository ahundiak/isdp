Just for grins, try implementing a query which returns
a dom tree

01 Feb 2001

These are the new ris interface routines.
They can be used in standalone programs.

Since mkmk does not understand .rc files, the makefile
was generated by hand.  While it's possible to mix c and rc stuff in 
one directory, the hand generated makefiles can be difficult.  So
this directory is limited to .rc files only.

Note that the dependencies between the rc files and their include files
are not fully setup for service packs.  May need to tweak this later.

The query routine has been has been optimized a bit from
the vds version.

The VDrsxUtil.rc file is actually a c file whose functions are used
by the other rc files.  The file was placed here to avoid load order
problems for service packs.
