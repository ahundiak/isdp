#   NAME
#
#   copy_part
#
#   SYNOPSIS
#
#   copy_part old_file_name new_file_name
#
#   DESCRIPTION
#
#   This script is just a wrapper around the EXNUC copyOS command.  It
#   is intended to be a complement to the copy_assembly command, so that
#   users use this script to manipulate "part" files and copy_assembly
#   to manipulate "assemblies" of parts.
#
#   NOTE
#
#   This script works only with shells compatible with ksh.
