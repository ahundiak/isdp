                   How to use the "Digitizer" program.
          
    1) Using the plot of the menu, place the menu draft squarely on 
       digitizer surface. (An InterAct-32 or an InterPro-32 with a
       digitizer is required.)
           
    2) Invoke the "Digitizer" program by the following keyin:

       a) # ../config/digitizer  <cr>

     The following prompts will appear in the command strip.
       b) Input paper menu file name > paper_menu  <cr>
       c) Give origin (lower left corner)  << data point >>
       d) Give diagonal point (upper right corner) << data point >>
       e) Identify lower left point (double reset to exit) << data point >>
                                                           << dbl reset >>
       f) Identify upper right point  << data point >>
*      g) keyin response associated with this box > 9 <cr>
       h) keyin command associated > place line  <cr>

     Repeat steps (e),(f),(g) and (h) for all commands on the menu.
           
    3) The file generated by the "Digitizer" program should be put in  
       the config directory of the product.  We suggest that the file
       be named paper_menu.  This is the file that will be needed in
       response to the request for the paper menu file.
           
       
    NOTE:  There is a small time delay for the cursor tracking.  There-
           fore DO NOT input the cursor points too fast or the coordinates
           may not be correct.  The software will not allow command blocks
	   that are smaller than .3 of an inch square.

       *   The "9" means that a command string will be put on the input queue.
           A "23" means that a command key will be put on the input queue.
