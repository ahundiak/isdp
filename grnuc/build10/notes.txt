Need to rebuild grnuc in a more or less standard fashion

spec is currently empty
cc - Loads and executes .so files
ingrsys/tools.h - bunch of stuff

src seems to hold all stuff or real interest

build.sh
  linkspec
    empties spec

make.all
  grmkcob.sh
   finds all the make.sl fies under src
   make -rkf make.sl

TODO take a look at /opt/ingr/include/FSTypes.h and ensure Boolean is correct
     SS.h in FORMS/include is not so good

makefile
  should have a master include and/or rules
  clean
  slic
  -r -k should be optional

dot_m
  should have reasonable defaults
