PROGRAM:  assoc_data

1.  To invoke
    a.  Get into some object space (EMS, VDS, etc. design file)
    b.  Key-in:	ci=assoc_data

2.  Prompts user for name of input file containing query statements to
    send to geometric objects in the design file.

    An input file would look like the following:

	insert in $tbl where attrib1 = $a1 and attrib2 = $a2
	insert in $parts where attrib1 = $b1 and attrib2 = $b2
	insert in $tires where attrib1 = $c1 and attrib2 = $c2
	insert in $bolts where attrib1 = $d1 and attrib2 = $d2
	insert in $nuts where attrib1 = $e1 and attrib2 = $e2
	insert in $designs where attrib1 = $f1 and attrib2 = $f2

3.  Prompts the user for the name of an output file which will
    hold those query statements, with the actual attribute values
    (retrieved using this program) substituted for the $-prefixed tokens in
    the input file.

4.  Retrieves a user-specified set of objects (via a fence or graphic group).

5.  Reads SQL (or other db query) statements from an input file.

6.  For each statement
    a. For each object in the set, 
         It substitutes tokens beginning with the dollar sign ($)
         with the attribute value for that object and writes
	 that to an output file.

	 For other tokens (non-dollar sign tokens), it simply
	 passes the string to the output file.
