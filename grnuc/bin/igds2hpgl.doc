	IGDS-to-HPGL translator has several components. 

	  1. igds2hpgl		- executable
	  2. HPGLOF.b		- HPGL offline driver (ODI)
	  3. hpglof.db		- HPGL offline driver device attributes
	  4. igdserr.msg	- IGDS MFI error message file
	  5. stroke.msg		- Stroker error message file
	  6. ploterr.msg	- ODI error message file
	  7. fontlib		- IGDS font library file

	The file names may be changed to suit your needs. However, the driver
	name must remain as is.

	Three environment variables need to be set before the translator is
	executed. The first is 'export ODI_ERRMSGFILE=filename' where filename
	is the complete pathname of the ODI error message file. It could be
	undefined at the end with 'unset ODI_ERRMSGFILE.'  The second
        is 'export IGDSPATH=path' where path is the path to a directory
	that contains the igdserr.msg and stroke.msg files.  The third
        environment variable is 'export DEV_ATT=filename' where this is
        the complete pathname of the HPGL device attributes file.

        Example of setting all three variables.
 	export DEV_ATT=/usr2/igds2hpgl/hpglof.db
	export IGDSPATH=/usr2/igds2hpgl
	export ODI_ERRMSGFILE=/usr2/igds2hpgl/ploterr.msg

	The following is the command line to execute the translator:

	  igds2hpgl -d device -e 12x10 -l fontlibname -o outputfile < metafile


	Command line switches:

	    -d device		(ex. /usr/igds/HPGLOF.b)

	    -l fontlibname	(complete pathname of font library file)

	    -o outputfile	(ex. /usr/igds/hpgl.out)

	    The following are used to specify plot size (xsize, ysize):
		-e inches
		-m centimeters
		-a ANSI size codes (A, B, C, D, E)
		-i ISO size codes  (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4)
	    

	NOTE: The plot will always be centered on the paper regardless of
	      the plot size or paper size.
