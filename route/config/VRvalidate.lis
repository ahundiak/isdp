# Created 8/23/00 by jvh
#
#   To add your command, list the ppl
# name first then the description you
# want to have displayed. 
#
#   A '#' sign in the first column of
# this file makes the line
# a comment line and is not read.
#
#   If you want your ppl output to be read
# into the VSvalidate window, direct the
# output data into a file named '.process.log'
# in the current directory. After the "fix CMD's"
# button is hit your ppl is executed and when
# it is finished VSvalidate reads .process.log
# into the form. 
#
#   If you have Objects that you
# want access to in the VSvalidate form, you 
# must use 'ID[', 'Id[' or 'id[' before the 
# object id and a ',' then the osnum. 
# the closing ']' is not nessary but will 
# make the output look better in the form.
