=== DHPC ===

Try building a machine from scratch using DHCP.  First attempt will be done at home.

Solaris 10 Willow 03 DHCP, 540MB, 10GB, Bridged

Interface is e1000g0

Something is up with the laptop, could not get the graphic started.  Try reducing screen resolution.  Went from 1600x1200 to 1280x1024.  Same thing on the second try.  Screen goes to a gray background, no windows or what not.  Wonder if the iso image got messed up or maybe because the client got updated from 6.5.0 to 6.5.2.

Might have just been using the passport drive.  I downloaded Solaris 10 5/09 onto the laptop disk.  Seems to have started ok.

Need domain name: ingrnet (or ingrnet.com?)
Need address of DNS server

Under windows used: ipconfig /all

DNS Search list : left empty

Got a DNS error but accepted it anyways.  Did not ask for netmask.  Accepted defaults for everything else.
