#summary SVN Information

= Introduction =

Downloaded from sunfreeware along with a bunch of dependencies. 1.6.2

Use the impd use for the initial tests, later will want to setup a svn user

{{{
svnadmin create $HOME/svn/isdp

svn import /home/impd/ws02/libxc file:///home/impd/svn/isdp/libxc -m "Initial Import"

svn copy file:///home/impd/svn/isdp/libxc/trunk file:///home/impd/svn/isdp/libxc/tags/original

svn co file:///home/impd/svn/isdp/libxc/trunk libxc
}}}

So basically you setup the trunk/branches/tags layout, import the files then copy the initial trunk into a tags/original.  You can then check out the trunk and start making changes as desired.

Assuming that later on the repository can be transferred to a server based system.

=== Google Code Repository ===
{{{
svn checkout https://isdp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ isdp --username ahundiak

Worked from tortoise SVN on windows machine.

Checked in xforms from dawn Willow machine at home

Check the stuff back out on willow in the lab.  Had to set .subversion/servers proxy and port = 80.  Seemed to work ok.

The repository itself is setup like:
{{{
isdp
  branches
    original\xforms
  tags
  trunk
    xforms
    exnuc
    grnuc
}}}
Not really ideal for versioning individual modules but expect everything will end up in the trunk anyways.  Probably should try creating an initial checkin.

To make a branch:
{{{
svn mkdir https://isdp.googlecode.com/svn/branches/original \
   -m "ah for storing original solaris 8 code"

svn copy  https://isdp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/xforms  \
          https://isdp.googlecode.com/svn/branches/original \
         -m "ah xforms original"
}}}
