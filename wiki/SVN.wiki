#summary SVN Information

= Introduction =

Downloaded from sunfreeware along with a bunch of dependencies. 1.6.2

Use the impd use for the initial tests, later will want to setup a svn user

{{{
svnadmin create $HOME/svn/isdp

svn import /home/impd/ws02/libxc file:///home/impd/svn/isdp/libxc -m "Initial Import"

svn copy file:///home/impd/svn/isdp/libxc/trunk file:///home/impd/svn/isdp/libxc/tags/original

svn co file:///home/impd/svn/isdp/libxc/trunk libxc
}}}

So basically you setup the trunk/branches/tags layout, import the files then copy the initial trunk into a tags/original.  You can then check out the trunk and start making changes as desired.

Assuming that later on the repository can be transferred to a server based system.
