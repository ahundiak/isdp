# Solaris 10 Installation on HP xw4600 Work station.

= Introduction =

Tried once in December.  Neither the video nor the disk drives were being recognized.  Need to set the disk drives bios to use AHCI or IDE.

The video driver should work.  Just going to try again.

Want a 64-bit machine to sort of match what Avondale has.
