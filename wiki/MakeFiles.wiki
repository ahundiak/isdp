#summary Makefile information

= Introduction =

A considerable amount of time was spent in developing a makefile generator.

A php baed mmx program was developed for converting dotm files to makefiles.  Details to follow but a simple makefile in each directory will kick off the build process.  Auto generated makefiles will have a .mkx extension.

Need to sort of build and deploy at the same time.  Binaries go under /opt/ingr/bin and libraries end up under /opt/ingr/lib.  Just not sure how they will get there yet in an automated fashion.

To ignore a directory:

svn propset svn:ignore lib .

To ignore files within a directory

svn propset svn:ignore -F .ignore .

=== Make file targets ===

make clean - gets rid of all files not controlled by svn including .o, libraries, executables and even the generated makefile.mkx.

make debug - kicks off same makefile with -g option set

=== DOTM General ===

=== DOTM File layout ===

INCLUDE - List of include directories, passwd to CC/OPP/OMCPP

SPEC - List of .S file directories, passed as an additional include to OPP

DEPLIB - Seems to be overloaded.  List library and files that the target depends on. But it also seems to list thing that need to be linked in.  Problem is that the original designed relied heavily on archive(.a) type files with everything statically linked in.  Goint to try and ignore this section and move anything that still needs linking to LINKLIB.

LINKLIB - Libraries and files to link in
#ifdef LINK_OLD_STYLE
-lxcmalloc
-lxc
#endif

DEFINE - Not Sure

SPECIAL
POST_SPECIAL - Ignoring for now but denotes a set of commands end by END_SPECIAL

SVN - Have been ignoring the lib directory but that means it will need to be created for a completely clean build.  Which is probably ok.

Files with issues:
DIbsti.I - opp coredumps unless DIomac.h is in local directory
