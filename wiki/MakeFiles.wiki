#summary Makefile information

= Introduction =

A considerable amount of time was spent in developing a makefile generator.

A php baed mmx program was developed for converting dotm files to makefiles.  Details to follow but a simple makefile in each directory will kick off the build process.  Auto generated makefiles will have a .mkx extension.

Need to sort of build and deploy at the same time.  Binaries go under /opt/ingr/bin and libraries end up under /opt/ingr/lib.  Just not sure how they will get there yet in an automated fashion.
