Font metrics files are normally kept in the afm, bfm, & bfm2 directories.
Typefaces are normally kept in the tfFree, tfPay, and tfPost directories.

The font metrics and typeface files may not be present here because they
take up mongo space.  They exist on a tape (and a backup tape) somewhere.
This entire directory tree structure is saved on the tape, so it would be
wise to get only what you need off the tape, rather than get everthing off
the tape; some of the utilities on the tape may be outdated.

The db directory is where the "database" file of typefaces resides.  It
is a list of all typefaces Intergraph has received from Bitstream.
