Rebuilt by only including functions called by Exnuc

Used standard isdp.env and grmake

NDEBUG
SHLIB
SHFONT

Trying to avoid SH routines?

Also want to avoid Daemon stuff?

=====================================
fontserver/FStypes.h
typedef int Boolean;  Maybe need FSboolean;

Somewhere in Exnuc process (or was it Vds?) had to turn to
typedef char Boolean

FORMS/fs_include has copies of some of the hfiles, bit worrisome

Defined in X11/Intrinsics.h
typedef char Boolean;
Boolean XtDispatchEventToWidget(widget, event)
