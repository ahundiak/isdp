			Attributes Of Structural Elements

________________________________________________________________________________


	This is the list of the attributes of structural elements
	which may be accessed :

	- in the program of a Structural Selector vis the "attr()" function
	- in the "setup" file of the drawing extraction of structural elements
	  via the "attribute()" function.

	Moreover, the user-defined attributes may also be accessed by the
	two functions above.

	I = integer value
	D = double floating point value
	S = character string
