    			How to use the "Digitizer" program.
			====================================

    1) 	Using the plot of the menu, place the menu draft squarely on digitizer
	surface (InterAct-32 or InterPro-32 with a digitizer is required.)

    2) 	From a local window, keyin the following lines:

	a) $ digitizer  		<cr>

    3)  The following prompts will appear in the command strip:

       	a) Input paper menu file name > 		      <cr>
       	b) Give origin (lower left corner of menu,
	                           use command button only)   << comm point >>
       	c) Give diagonal point (upper right corner of menu,
	                           use command button only)   << comm point >>
       	d) Enter 1st diagonal point of box
	       (command button only, double command to exit)  << comm point >>
       	e) Enter 2nd diagonal point of box
	       (command button only, double command to exit)  << comm point >>
      	f) keyin response associated with this box >	      <cr>
       	g) keyin command key/string associated > 	      <cr>

    4)  Use the following explanations to respond to the prompts listed in
	section 3.  Repeat steps 3(d),(e),(f), and (g) for all commands to
	be used on the paper menu.

	a) In order to prevent the user from altering the default "paper_menu"
	   file located in /usr/ip32/ems/config, the user will have to keyin
	   the full path name and file name for the customized menu:

	   ie: /usr/login/my_menu     (or)  /usr/tmp/wire_mnu

	b) It is suggested that you use the lower left corner of the plot.
	   In this manner, the ascii file and corresponding paper menu can 
	   easily be transported to various devices by various users.

	c) Again, it is suggested that the user specify the upper right corner
	   of the plot for simplicity.

    NOTE:  If the user intends to deviate from the suggestions outlined in
	   steps (b) and (c), he/she should physically label the origin and
	   diagonal points as a courtesy to others and for future reference.

       	d) Enter 1st diagonal point of box
	       (command button only, double command to exit) << comm point >>
	   This step is self-explanatory.

       	e) Enter 2nd diagonal point of box
	       (command button only, double command to exit) << comm point >>
	   This step is self-explanatory.

    NOTE:  For steps (d) and (e), the order of the points does not matter
           as long as they identify a diagonal of the box.

    NOTE:  Since there is a small time delay for the cursor tracking, DO NOT
	   input points too quickly (or the coordinates may not be correct).
	   The software will not allow command blocks with an area smaller 
	   than two-tenths of a square inch (a "re-enter" prompt occurs).

	f) If a command string is to be provided for step (g), input "9".
           If a command key will be provided for step (g), input "23".

	g) If you are uncertain of the command name or command key, utilize
	   the "print command" utility in an I/EMS design session.




			How to use the "reset_track" program.
			====================================

    This program let user to change the window cursor tracking area.
    The new tracking area is in effect until the next "reset_track"
    is executed or the system is rebooted.


    1) 	From a local window, keyin the following lines:

	a) $ reset_track  		                       <cr>

    3)  The following prompts will appear in the command strip:

        a) Give first diagonal point of tracking area 
	               ( use command button only )             < comm point >
        b) Give second diagonal point of tracking area 
	               ( use command button only )             < comm point >


    NOTE:  The tracking area should not overlap with any other type
           of digitize region. ( paper menu etc.) 
           If you overlap tracking area and other digitize region,
           you have to use command button in the overlapped area to
	   access the digitize region.
