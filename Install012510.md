# Solaris 10 Installation on HP xw4600 Work station.

# Introduction #

Tried once in December.  Neither the video nor the disk drives were being recognized.  Need to set the disk drives bios to use AHCI or IDE.

The video driver should work.  Just going to try again.

Want a 64-bit machine to sort of match what Avondale has.

  1. Downloaded fresh 10/09 64 bit iso dvd image.
  1. F10 switch from RAID to AHCI
  1. BGE1 or BGE0 Ethernet?
  1. Got graphics this time!
