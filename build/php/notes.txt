Use the Korn Shell for file type but select php as the extension
The Run File command then works as expected
No need to use -q
Not sure if it will work in a browser but ok for now
Need to link /bin/php to the actual php executable

Be nice to replace some of the old build scripts with php stuff just to understand them better.
Have a makefile generator somewhere.  A php make processor might also be useful.

The basic idea behind make is simple

target: dependency
  execute commands

classes
MakeFile
MakeTarget
MakeTargetDependency
MakeTargetCommands
