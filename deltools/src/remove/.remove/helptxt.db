# This is the help text database. Any line that starts with a # (column 0)
# is considered a comment and is skipped when displaying the help text.
#
# Each help topic begins with the title line (">>" starting in column 0). The
# title line defines the entry point for the requested text. The first field
# of the title line defines the entry point name -- I use the filename of the
# associated FMLI menu/form. The remaining fields (delimited by white space
# from the first field) is the title of the help window ("Help on" will be
# pre-pended to the title when the help window appears).
