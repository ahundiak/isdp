# Strudel file for processing loft elements and putting information in neutral
#
#       This file should be changed by customers to reflect their internal
#       use of mark information and the latest properties definition
#       according to Alma's neutral file specification.  This file is ONLY an
#       example of how mark information could be interpreted.  Intergraph
#       cannot provide in the standard I/LOFT release Strudel files which meet
#       all the different customer criteria.  Please refer to the Strudel 
#       language documentation in the I/STRUCT and I/LOFT products.
