#   NAME
#
#   loft - invoke Loft via drive
#
#   SYNOPSIS
#
#   loft [Loft arguments]
#
#   DESCRIPTION
#
#   This script allows one to invoke Loft with drive in order to
#   ease the memory requirements of forking up subprocesses.
#
#   NOTE
#
#   This script works only with shells compatible with ksh.
#
#   However, this script could be easily modified to run under sh
#   -- although the result would be somewhat more verbose.
#
#   HISTORY
#
#   30 Sep 1997 law Added environment variable VD_CHECK_REF_LIB.
#   28 Mar 1989 jBk Enhanced echopath function to ignore lines in
#                   product_data file which begin with #.
#   08 Mar 1989 jBk Removed CAVEAT.
#                   Modified script not to write a subscript but
#                   to use the quotation of $@ in order to pass
#                   whitespace-containing arguments to the image.
#   02 Mar 1989 jBk Modified script so it complains if two or
#                   more distinct paths are found for a
#                   particular product.
#                   Reversed order of searches for I/IGE-I/EXNUC
#                   and I/DRAFT-I/GRNUC pairs so that complaints
#                   will be about I/EXNUC and I/GRNUC and not
#                   about the now obsolete I/IGE and I/DRAFT.
#   01 Feb 1989 jBk Enhanced to provide the ability to pass
#                   unchanged to the executable arguments
#                   containing whitespace.
#   20 Jan 1989 jBk Look for I/EXNUC and I/GRNUC as well as I/IGE
#                   and I/DRAFT.
#   03 May 1988 jBk Look for whitespace around product names so
#                   names that begin the same do not get
#                   confused.
#   27 Apr 1988 jBk Since we now have the wonderful product_data
#                   file, this script was rewritten to get paths
#                   from the file, /usr/ip32/product_data,
#                   instead of shell variables and/or
#                   derivations.  Even changed the comments!
#   26 Apr 1988 jBk Added exit directive to cause script to exit
#                   with returned status of image.
#   12 Mar 1988 jBk Improved robustness of deriving paths.  Also
#                   altered to cause app_path to be the directory
#                   above where this script resides, instead of
#                   an explicitly-named subdirectory of the
#                   second directory above where this script
#                   resides.
#   22 Mar 1988 jBk Modified so ${app_path}/bin/executableName is
#                   path for executable.
#   09 Mar 1988 jBk Fixed a typo in CIPATH definition.
#   24 Feb 1988 jBk Added CIPATH test and definition.
#                   Make path variable always the expanded path
#                   to the platform.
#                   If ${IGE}, ${DRAFT} and/or ${VDS} are
#                   directories, use these definitions instead of
#                   relative paths.
#   24 Feb 1988 AIC Fixed a typo.
#   23 Feb 1988 jBk Uppercased ige variable to IGE since that is
#                   the new standard name.
#   21 Feb 1988 AIC If ${IGE} is a directory, use
#                   ${IGE}/bin/drive instead of the relative
#                   ige/bin/drive. 
#   23 Dec 1987 jBk Slightly altered NOTE.
#   24 Nov 1987 jBk Creation.
