                Summary

                I   - Reporting Over View

                II  - Existing Reports




I -  REPORTING OVER VIEW
========================

	To use I_LOFT reporting system, an user ASCII file is read by
	I_STRUCT Apfel-Strudel language.

	The hardcoded name for this ASCII file is : "RPsetup".
	The I/LOFT product delivers the default file :

			"$LOFT/config/drawing/RPsetup".

	Like in I_VDS drawing extraction, if an "RPsetup" file already exists
	in the working directory, it is used instead of the default file.

	For a better management of unit system, two includes files exist :

			"$LOFT/config/drawing/RPdefine.eng"
			"$LOFT/config/drawing/RPdefine.met"
	
	During installation of I/LOFT one of them is copied into :

			"$LOFT/config/drawing/RPdefine"




II - EXISTING REPORTS

	For each report are defined state keywords and reporting functions.
	They are prefixed by "vl-rp".
