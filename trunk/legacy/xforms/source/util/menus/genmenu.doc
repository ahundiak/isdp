+.  genmenu Utility

NAME
	genmenu - menu generation utility

SYNOPSIS
	genmenu [-v] [-p <palette prefix>] <outline> <menu file>

DESCRIPTION
	Genmenu creates I/FORMS panel, bar and pocket menu files from
	text outlines.

	If a dash, `-', is specified for <outline>, genmenu reads the
	outline from standard input (stdin).
	
	If the -v option is specified, genmenu prints a description of
	the menu to standard output (stdout).

	Error messages are printed to standard error (stderr).


	When creating a panel menu, <menu file> contains only the data
	from the first palette.  The other palettes are written to
	files with names generated from the palette names in the outline
	and the optional <palette prefix>.  A palette file name is the
	first 14 characters from:

			<palette prefix><palette name>

	In the file name, characters other than letters, numbers, the
	period, `.', and the underbar, `_', are replaced by underbars.

	For example:
	o  If <palette prefix> is not defined and the palette name is
	   `File Manipulations', the palette file is named `File_Manipulat'.
	o  If <palette prefix> is `EM' and the palette name is `Design',
	   the palette file is named `EMDesign'.

EXAMPLES
	The command line:

	    genmenu panel.otl PANEL_MENU

	reads the panel menu outline `panel.otl' and writes the palette
	files to the current directory.  The first palette's file name
	is `PANEL_MENU' and the other palette file names are derived from
	the palette names.

	The command line:

	    genmenu -v bar.otl $DRAFT_MENUS/BAR_MENU >bar.log

	reads the bar menu outline `bar.otl', writes a description of the
	menu to `bar.log', and writes the palette file `BAR_MENU' in the
	$DRAFT_MENUS directory.
