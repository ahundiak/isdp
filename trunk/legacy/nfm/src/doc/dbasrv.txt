DBASRV is a RIS client / NFM combined client/server that can provide any
DM/DBA product with a connection to an NFM or any other RIS database.  To
allow your PC's to be serviced by DBASRV, the following setup is required:

On the UNIX server/workstation:

	1) Become superuser

	2) Edit /etc/services and add the line:

dbasrv          764/tcp         # DB Access Server

	3) Edit /etc/inetd.conf and add the line

dbasrv stream tcp nowait root /usr/ip32/dba/bin/dbasrv dbasrv 

	Three optional arguments can be added to the end of this line
	that provide additional features:

	Debug log - if you want a log of server activity generated, 
	append the log file name to the end of this line (for example,
	"/usr/tmp/dbasrv.log").  If you don't want a log, but wish to
	use one of the other arguments, specify "NONE".

	NFM Load User Info - by default, DBASRV will run as the NFMADMIN 
	user.  To force DBASRV to run as the user specified ("root", in the
	example above), specify "NO_USER_LOAD".  If you don't want to run as 
	root, but wish to use the third argument, specify "USER_LOAD".

	Net buffer size - used to specify the maximum number of bytes
	transported across the net when fetching from the database.

	NOTE:	Specify "4096" when running a DBASRV version 5.0.2 or
		later with a DM/DBA version 5.0.1 client.

	For example:

dbasrv stream tcp nowait root /usr/ip32...dbasrv dbasrv NONE USER_LOAD 4096

	4) Stop and start TCPIP (or reboot)


On the PC:

	Invoke DM/DBA with -n switch:

	   c:\win32app\ingr\dba\bin\rundba.exe -n my_unix_node 

	The -n switch specifies which unix node to run DBASRV on.
