Workflow Interface Exercise - I/NFM 3.2
 
*************************************************************************
Update Notice - I/NFM 3.2   The class name should not be modified. The
workflow interface will allow the modification of the class name, but the
operation will fail during process.
************************************************************************* 
 
What you will be doing: 
---------------------- 
 
o Making modifications to workflow attributes (workflow description, state
  name, etc.) 
o Adding a new class of user 
o Adding a new command and transition for Make Transition 
o Removing an existing class 
o Removing an existing state 
o Adding signoffs to the workflow 
o Creating an ascii file from the modified training workflow
 
Descriptions/Steps
------------------
o Log into the Workflow Interface as an administrator   
   $ /usr#/ip32/nfm/bin/Nfmwff
 
o Select the Load Workflow Command (Workflow - Load Workflow)   
  - keyin /usr#/ip32/nfm/doc/NFMtrain.32   
  - this is TRAINING_WORKFLOW32
 
o Display Workflows
  - verify that TRAINING_WORKFLOW32 has been added
 
How to Use the "Define Workflow" forms 
-------------------------------------- 
The "Define Workflow" command uses four forms for workflow definition. 
 
    Form 1 - Workflow information form     
    Form 2 - Class and State definition form     
    Form 3 - Transition definition form     
    Form 4 - Class Access for Transitions form 
 
There are five buttons in the upper right corner of each form. These buttons
allow the user to identify the current form, move to a different form, cancel
the "Define Workflow" command, save changes to the database without exiting
the command, and exit the command and save the changes. 
 
  Form identification button - A number that identifies the current form     
  Form scroll buttons - This is actually two buttons   
    - Up arrow - Moves to a prior form (for example, if current form is "4",
      moves to "3". If the current form is "1", move will be to "4")   
    - Down arrow - Moves to the next form (for example, if current form is
      "3",     moves to "4". If the current form is "4", move will be to "1").     
  Cancel button - From any form, cancels the command and does not save changes
  Run button - From any form, saves all changes without exiting the command
  Exit and Save - From any form, exits the command and saves all changes 
 
All changes made while in a "Define Workflow" session are kept in memory until
the changes are saved when the user exits (Exit and Save) any form or a class
or state is deleted (forces a save of all changes). All changes are discarded
if the user cancels from any form.
 
Making modifications to workflow attributes 
------------------------------------------- 
o With TRAINING_WORKFLOW32 active, select the "Define Workflow" command 
 
    The "Define Workflow" command is under the Workflow button on the panel
    menu. (Workflow --> Define Workflow) 
 
o Change the workflow description (Form 1)
 
    Select the description field. Change the description to "Modified Training
    Workflow" or a description of your choice.
 
  ## Note - TR 92W2883 - The entire description will not show since the field
  on the form is only using 20 characters
 
o Change the name and description of the "appproval complete" state (Form 2)
 
    - Select the "appproval complete" state from the list of states
    - Edit the name to be "approval complete"
    - Edit the description to be "Item approval complete"
 
o Change settings on the "Review Item Attributes" transition (Form 3)
 
    - Select "Review Item Attributes" from the list of transitions
    - Toggle from "Log on Success" to "No logging on Success"
    - Toggle from "Log on Failure" to "No logging on Failure"
    - Toggle from "Notify on Transition" to "No Transition Notify"
 
o Give the designer class access to the Check In command in the "creation
  complete" state (Form 4)
 
    - Select the designer class from the list of classes
    - Highlight the transition for "Check In Item" with a "From State" of
      "creation complete" (be careful not to change any other transitions)
    - Select the "Update Class Access to Transitions" button to update the
      access
 
Adding a new class of user
--------------------------
o Add a new class of users (Form 2)
 
    - Keyin "executive manager" into the Class Name field
    - Select the "Add Class" button to add the class
    - Verify that the class was added to the list of classes at the top of the
      form
 
o Set up class access for the new class (Form 4)
 
    The "executive manager" class will be given access to all transitions.
 
    - Select the "executive manager" class from the list of classes
    - Select the "Select All Transitions" button from the bottom of the form
    - Select the "Update Class Access to Transitions" button to update the
      access
 
o Exit and Save
 
    A "Modifying existing workflow" message then "Successful Completion" will
    appear in the message strip.
 
Verification of Changes
-----------------------
o Display the states and check the results of the modifications
 
    - Select the "Display States" command from the bar menu 
    - Verify the changes made (approval state name and description)
 
o Display the classes and check the results
 
    - Select the "Display Classes" command from the bar menu
    - Verify that the new class has been added (executive manager)
 
o Display the transitions and check the results of the modifications

      notification off)
 
o Display the class access and check the results of the modifications
 
    - Select the "Display Class Access to Transitions" command from the bar
      menu
    - Verify the changes made ("designer" class access to Check In Item)
    - Verify access for the executive manager class
 
Adding a new command and transition for Make Transition
-------------------------------------------------------
o Add the new command
 
    A command that a user adds is not a real I/NFM command, but is a command
    used to allow transitions occurring during "Make Transition" to be treated
    properly through the workflow cycle. Normal users will not see the command
    name, so the name of the command is just used to describe the transition
    for the administrator manipulating the workflow.
 
    - Select the "Add Commands" button on the panel menu ("Usr Com" --> "Add
      Commands")
    - Keyin "Executive Release" in the command name field
    - Select the "Add Command" button at the bottom of the form
    - Verify that the command was added to the list of commands 
    - Exit and Save
 
o The TRAINING_WORKFLOW32 should be the active workflow
 
    If the TRAINING_WORKFLOW32 is not the active workflow, either use the
    Display Workflows command and select TRAINING_WORKFLOW32, or select the
    workflow from the pop-up list activated by the arrow beside the Workflow
    Name field.
 
o Select the Define Workflow command 
 
o Add a transition for the "Executive Release" command (Form 3)
 
    You will be adding a new transition that allows an item to be transitioned
    directly from the "creation complete" state to the "released" state.
 
    - Select the "Executive Release" command from the list of commands in the
      middle of the form
    - Key "Executive Release" into the transition name field
    - Select "Log on Success" 
    - Select "Log on Failure" 
    - Select "Notify on Transition" 
    - Select a "From State" of "creation complete"
    - Select a "To State" of "released"
    - Select the "Add Transition" button to add the transition to the workflow
    - Verify that the transition was added to the list of transitions at the
      top of the form
 
o Add class access for the new transition (Form 4)
 
    Only the "executive manager" will be able to access the new transition.
 
    - Select "executive manager" from the list of classes
    - Highlight the "Executive Release" transition for the executive manager
      class (hint - the new transition is at the bottom of the list)
    - Select the "Update Class Access to Transitions" button to update the
      access

    - Select "bad class" from the list of classes
    - Select the "Delete Class" button 
    - Select "OK" on the confirm form (Note - this saves all changes to the
      database)
    - Verify that the class is removed from the list of classes (at the top of
      the form)
 
Removing an existing state
--------------------------
o Remove the "bad state" state (Form 2)
 
    - Select "bad state" from the list of states in the state section of the
      form
    - Select the "Delete State" button from the bottom of the form
    - Select "OK" on the confirm form (Note - this saves all changes to the
      database)
    - Verify that the state has been removed from the list of states
 
o Exit (the changes have already been saved)
 
Verify Changes
--------------
o Display the states and verify that the "bad state" state has been removed
 
    - Select the "Display States" command from the bar menu 
    - Verify that "bad state" no longer exists
 
o Display the classes and verify that the "bad class" class has been removed
 
    - Select the "Display Classes" command from the bar menu
    - Verify that the "bad class" has been removed
 
o Display the transitions and verify that the new transition was added
 
    - Select the "Display Transitions" command from the bar menu

o Display the class access and verify that the "executive manager" class has
  access to the new transition
 
    - Select the "Display Class Access to Transitions" command from the bar
      menu
    - Verify that the "executive manager" has access to the "Executive
      Release" transition
 
Adding signoffs to the workflow
-------------------------------
    In this exercise you will be adding a signoff state between the "approval
    complete" state and the "released" state.
 
o Add the new command
 
    First the command that will be used for the transition to the signoff
    state should be added. (This is not a real I/NFM command, but is used to
    allow transitions occurring during the "Make Transition" command to be
    treated properly through the workflow cycle. The users will not see the
    command, so the name of the command is just used to describe the
    transition for the administrator manipulating the workflow).
 
    - Select the "Add Commands" button on the panel menu ("Usr Com" --> "Add
      Commands")
    - Keyin "Move to Signoff" in the command name field (if this command
      already exists, skip the rest of this section)
    - Select the "Add Command" button at the bottom of the form
    - Verify that the command was added to the list of commands 
    - Exit and Save
 
o The TRAINING_WORKFLOW32 should be the active workflow
 
    If the TRAINING_WORKFLOW32 is not the active workflow, either use the
    Display Workflows command and select TRAINING_WORKFLOW32, or select the
    workflow from the pop-up list activated by the arrow beside the Workflow
    Name field.
 
o Select the "Define Workflow" command 
 
o Add a new class of users for signoff users (Form 2)
 
    A user that will be signing off on an item should have access to some of
    the commands involving the item. The signoff user should have access to
    the following commands at a minimum:
 
      Copy Item Files - so the user can look at the files
      Copy Set Files - if the item may be a set
      Signoff on Item - mandatory
      Display List of Signoffs on Item
      Display Signoff History
 
    Unless all users that will be involved in a signoff will already belong to
    one of the classes in a workflow that allow the commands above, a new
    class should be added that will be the users that are involved in the
    signoff process but are not in one of the other classes that allow the
    needed access to the commands. You will be adding a new class of users
    called "signoff user" and setting up the necessary command access for this
    new class.
 
    - Keyin "signoff user" into the Class Name field
    - Select the "Add Class" button to add the class
    - Verify that the class was added to the list of classes at the top of the
      form
 
o Add a new state for the signoff state (See the diagrams on page 12)
 
    You will be adding a new state between "approval complete" and "released"
    that requires signoffs. The new state needs to be added with the
    appropriate attributes to make it a signoff state. 
 
    - Keyin "release signoff" into the State Name field
    - Keyin "Release signoff in progress" into the description field
    - Keyin "4" into the Sequence No. field
    - Key number into the Minimum No. of Signoffs field ("1" is a good number)
    - Choose type of signoff ("Mandatory" or "Majority")
    - The "transition from" toggle must be "Make Transition From State"
    - The "transition to" toggle must be "Make Transition To State"
    - Select the "Add State" button on the bottom of the form to add the state
 
  Check the "released" state to make sure the sequence number changed to "5"
  (automatic resequencing is a new feature of I/NFM 3.2).
 
o Add the new transitions needed (Form 3)
 
    There are four commands that are associated with the signoff
    functionality. The transitions for these commands need to be added to the
    workflow along with the transitions associated with the new state.
 
    Add the transitions for the new commands. 
 
    - Select the "Display List of Signoffs on Item" command from the list of
      commands in the middle of the form
    - Keyin "Display List of Signoffs on Item" for the Transition Name

      the form
 
o Exit and Save 
 
    Signoffs have now been added to this workflow. Display States, Classes,
    Transitions, and Class Access if desired to verify that information has
    been properly added.
 
States Added to the Workflow for Signoffs
-----------------------------------------
 
    States Before Signoff               States After Signoff
 
 
       creation                            creation
       complete                            complete
          1                                   1
 
 
 
     modification                        modification
       complete                            complete
          2                                   2

                                              4
 
 
 
                                           released
                                              5
 
Note -- Another transition needs to be added that allows a reject between the
"release signoff" state and the "approval complete" state.
 
Dump Workflow
-------------
I/NFM 3.2 includes a new feature to create an ascii file from an existing
workflow. This is called the "Dump Workflow" command.
 
o   Select the "Dump Workflow" command. (Workflow - Dump Workflow)
 
o   Keyin the filename for the ascii file.
 
o   View the ascii file to make sure the information is correct.
 
How to Do Field Edits
---------------------
The mouse will allow you to make a field active and place the cursor. The
following commands will allow you to make edits to the field:
 
   <cntr> k - Delete from the cursor to the end of the line
   <cntr> d - Delete the character the cursor is on
   <delete> - Delete the character before the cursor
 
   <cntr> a - Go to the beginning of the field
   <cntr> e - Go to the end of the field
   <cntr> f - Go forward one character
   <cntr> b - Go backward one character
