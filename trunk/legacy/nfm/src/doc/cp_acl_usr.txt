COPY ACL USERS
--------------
 
OBJECTIVES -
 
   The Copy ACL Users command allows an administrative user to copy the users
   from one ACL to a new ACL. 
 
USAGE
 
   This command will be useful if a new ACL is needed on a new workflow and
   the users are the same or similar to the users on an existing workflow ACL.
   For example, if a group of users are working on several different types of
   items that need different workflows, the users can be associated with the
   ACLs of each workflow by creating one ACL and then copying the users to
   ACLs on the other workflows. 
 
   This command will also be useful if the states on an existing workflow need
   to be altered. The administrator can 
 
   -   create a new workflow with the new states
   -   copy the ACLs on the original workflow
   -   move the items to the new workflow.
   -   delete the ACLs on the old workflow
   -   delete the old workflow
 
DESIGN
 
   Before this command can be executed there must be an active ACL. 
 
   This command does the following:
 
   -   prompts the user for the workflow of the new ACL (selection list)
   -   prompts the user for the name of the new ACL (keyin)
   -   for each class in the new workflow, the user will choose a class in the
       old ACL. The users in the old ACL class will be used as the users in
       the new ACL class.
   -   if both the old workflow and the new workflow have signoff states, for
       each signoff state in the new workflow the user will choose a signoff
       state in the old ACL. The signoff users in the old ACL signoff state
       will be the signoff users in the new signoff state for the new ACL.
 
EXAMPLE
 
   For the following explanations on the interfaces, assume the following:
 
   Active ACL: ACL_TO_BE_COPIED, Workflow: OLD_WORKFLOW
     Classes:           Signoff States:
       class1              so_state1
       class2              so_state2
       class3
       class4
 
   New ACL: NEW_ACL, Workflow: NEW_WORKFLOW
     Classes:           Signoff States:
       new_class1          new_so_state1
       new_class2          new_so_state2
                           new_so_state3
 
FORMS INTERFACE
 
   If there is no ACL active, the forms interface will force the user to
   select an active ACL before the command will execute.
 
   Form 1 - Asks for the new ACL name (NEW_ACL) and workflow (NEW_WORKFLOW)
 
   Form2
 
    COPY ACL USERS from ACL "ACL_TO_BE_COPIED" to New ACL "NEW_ACL"
 
       ------------------------------------------------------
      | Class/State | New Class/State   | Copied Class/State |
       ------------------------------------------------------
      | class       | new_class1        |                    |     
      | class       | new_class2        |                    |     
      | state       | new_so_state1     |                    |     
      | state       | new_so_state2     |                    |     
      | state       | new_so_state3     |                    |     
      |             |                   |                    |
       ------------------------------------------------------
 
 
       Class to Copy (State to Copy)
       ----------------
      |                |        ---------
      |                |       |  Clear  | (Clear Copied State)
      |                |       |  Copied |
      |                |       |  Class  | <--- Clear Button
      |                |        ---------
      |                |            
      |                |            
      |                | <--- Validation List
       ----------------
 
   To select the information wanted, the user must highlight each row on the
   top form and then select the class or state in the validation list for the
   users. The validation list heading is dynamic depending on whether a class
   or signoff state row is selected. The 'clear button' text is dynamic
   depending on the row selected.
 
   If a class row is selected, the validation list will be the classes in
   ACL_TO_BE_COPIED (class1, class2, class3, and class4). The text over the
   validation list will be "Class to Copy" and the 'clear button' text will be
   "Clear Copied Class". If a user has selected class information for the
   "Copied Class/State" field on the form and then wants to clear this
   information, the "Clear Copied Class" button is used to clear the
   highlighted class information.
 
   State information will only appear if both the original ACL and the new ACL
   have signoff state associated with them. If a state row is selected, the
   validation list will be the signoff states in ACL_TO_BE_COPIED (so_state1,
   so_state2). The text over the validation list will be "State to Copy" and
   the 'clear button' text will be "Clear Copied State". If a user has
   selected state information for the "Copied Class/State" field on the form
   and then wants to clear this information, the "Clear Copied State" button
   is used to clear the highlighted state information.
 
ALPHA INTERFACE
 
   Before the Copy ACL Users command can be executed, there must the an active
   ACL. The alpha interface will prompt for the ACL within the command if
   there is no ACL active. 
 
   Assuming that there is NO active ACL or workflow, the following occurs:
 
   "List of I/NFM workflows" and a selection list (select the workflow of the
   ACL to be copied - OLD_WORKFLOW)
 
   "List of ACLs in Workflow OLD_WORKFLOW" (select the ACL to be copied)
 
   "Choose 'Workflow Number' of NEW ACL" (select NEW_WORKFLOW)
 
   "Enter Access Control List Name" (keyin "NEW_ACL")
 
   "Choose Class in old ACL 'ACL_TO_BE_COPIED' for users in class 'new_class1'
   of new ACL 'NEW_ACL'". For the next two screens the selection list would
   be:
       class1
       class2
       class3
       class4
 
   "Choose Class in old ACL 'ACL_TO_BE_COPIED' for users in class 'new_class2'
   of new ACL 'NEW_ACL'". (Selection list above)
 
   "Choose signoff state on old ACL 'ACL_TO_BE_COPIED' for signoff users in
   signoff state 'new_so_state1' of new ACL 'NEW_ACL". For the next three
   screens, the selection list would be:
       so_state1
       so_state2
 
   "Choose signoff state on old ACL 'ACL_TO_BE_COPIED' for signoff users in
   signoff state 'new_so_state2' of new ACL 'NEW_ACL". (Selection list above)
 
   "Choose signoff state on old ACL 'ACL_TO_BE_COPIED' for signoff users in
   signoff state 'new_so_state3' of new ACL 'NEW_ACL". (Selection list above)
