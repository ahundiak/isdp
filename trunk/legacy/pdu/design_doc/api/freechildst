Name
  pdmoFreeChildStructure

 
Abstract:

Frees the child structure linked list.

Description:

  This API frees the linked list of structure that has been used to add or
  change or delete the 1st level children associated with a part.
  They are associated with the following API functions:

   1. pdmoDefineAssembly
   2. pdmoAddPartToAssembly
   3. pdmoModifyAssembly
   4. pdmoFreeChildStructure

 
Function Protocol:

pdmoFreeChildStructure(
                      PDMchildren *spr_PDMstructure
                       )

  Input:
   PDMchildren  *spr_PDMstructure - Linked list containing the children info
                                     which makeup the assembly

  Output:

	None

  Input Limitations:

    spm_PDMstructure:   required
                        a linked list of structures
                        pdmoLoadChildStructure must be called before calling
                        pdmoFreeChildStructure
 Return Status:

	PDM_S_SUCCESS    - Successful COmpletion
	PDM_E_NULL_LIST  - Input is a null pointer

External Functions:
 None

Assumptions:
None

Impacts:
None

Future:
None

Algorithm:

- if spm_PDMstructure is NULL
	- return error message
- free each entry in the link list
- set the pointer to the link list to NULL
- set the status
- return
