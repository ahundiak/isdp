  Abstract: 

  This function is used to logout of an nfm environment and
  diconnect from the underlying database.
  
  Keywords:

  Logout

  Function Protocol: 

  pdmOLogout()
  
  Inputs:

  None
  
  Outputs:

  None
  
  Return Status:

  PDM_S_SUCCESS
  nfm error messages

  External Functions:

  PDUload_exec_structure()
  PDMterminate()
  
  Assumptions: 

  Logout is called only after a successfull login has occurred.

  Impacts:

  Global variables PDU_apiflag, PDU_apimessage are modified.
  Global structure PDMuser is modified. The PDMterminate function
  will need to set the PDU_IS_LOGGED_IN flag to 0.
  
  Algorithm:

  load exec structure
   call PDUload_exec_structure("","","","","LOGOUT","","",0,0)
  call PDMterminate
  if success
   reset structures
    clear PDMStorageArea
    clear PDUuser
   reset global PDM_apiflag
   reset global PDM_apimessage to null
   return PDM_S_SUCCESS
  else
   return status
