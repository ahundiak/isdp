  Title:     Design Document - Add Delete Part command to PDM Utilities form
  Date:      9/1/93
  Revision:  2


  Abstract:  

  This document describes the necessary changes to add the delete part
  command to the PDM Utilities form.

  The user will select a part(s) either in the Part Selection area or the
  Parts/Files Listing area on the PDM Utilities form.  When the user selects
  the delete part command, a prompt for confirmation will be displayed.  If 
  the user does not confirm, the command will be cancelled.  If the user
  confirms, all selected parts will be deleted.


  Keywords:

  Delete Part


  Return Status:

	PDM_S_SUCCESS
        PDM_I_PART_IN_ASS
        PDM_E_PART_OCCURS_IN_ASSEMBLY


  Assumptions:

  The user must select a part before invoking the command.
 

  Impacts:

  The user will still be able to delete a part through Change Mode on the
  Part Operations form.

  The user will be able to select a single part or multiple parts for
  deletion through the PDM Utilites form.

  The user will not have to wait for attribute retrieval before deleting each
  part through the PDM Utilities form.
 

  Future:

  None


  Test Cases:

    Success
 
  Enter a part in the part selection area and select Delete Part.

  Retrieve a list of parts, select one part and select Delete Part.

  Retrieve a list of parts, select multiple parts and select Delete Part.
 
    Failure
 
  Select a part that is used in and assembly and select Delete Part.
  

  Algorithm for command:

  - if no parts are selected, display error message PDM_E_NO_PARTS_SELECTED

  - prompt user,  "All selected parts will be deleted.  Continue? y/n [y]"
  - if answer = n
	- cancel the command
        - display message PDM_E_COMMAND_CANCELLED
  - else if answer = y
	- continue
  - else display error message PDM_E_INVALID_INPUT

  - if only one part is selected
	- call PDUload_refresh_from_parts_list
 
  - call PDUcheck_part("delete part", DELETE_PART)
  	- if part in part selection area is being used
                - call PDUmulti_delete_part
        - else if multiple parts are selected
                - for each part
                        - write the part to the refresh structure
                        - copy the part information to the part
                          selection area of the PDM Utilities form
                        - call PDUmulti_delete_part
 

  Algorithm for function PDUfast_delete_part:

  - check to see if part is checked in
	- if part is checked out, return error message
  - validate access
  - call PDMcheck_delete_part
  - if status != SUCCESS, return status
  - call PDMrdelete_part
  - call PDMset_to_state
  - call FIfld_delete_rows to delete the row from the parts listing field
  - check for multiple files and call FIfld_delete_rows for each additional file
  - decrement PDU_selected_rows
  - reset number of rows in field FIfld_set_num_rows
  - call function to delete the row(s) from PDU_parts_list_bufr


  Form Changes:
 
  - add delete part button to PDM Utilities form
