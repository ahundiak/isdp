  Abstract:  

  This document describes the necessary changes to add the move to next state
  command to the PDM Utilities form.

  The user will select a part(s) either in the Part Selection area or the
  Parts/Files Listing area on the PDM Utilities form.  When the user selects
  the move to next state part command the Move State form will be displayed.  
  The parts will then be displayed and transitioned in groups of parts that 
  have the same workflow and current state moving to the same state.  As
  each set of parts is processed, the next set will be displayed until all
  parts have been processed.  The user may cancel the form at any time without
  processing any parts.


  Keywords:

  State Move


  Return Status:

	PDM_S_SUCCESS


  Assumptions:

  The user must select a part before invoking the command.
 

  Impacts:

  The user will still be able to move a part to the next state through 
  Change Mode on the Part Operations form.

  The user will be able to select a single part or multiple parts for
  move to next state.

  The user will not have to wait for attribute retrieval before moving a part
  to the next state.
 

  Future:

  None


  Test Cases:

    Success
 
  Enter a part in the part selection area and select Move to Next State.

  Retrieve a list of parts, select one part and select Move to Next State.

  Retrieve a list of parts, select multiple parts and select Move to Next State.
 
    Failure

  Select a part that has never been checked in and select Move to Next State.
 

  Algorithm:

  - if no parts are selected, display error message PDM_E_NO_PARTS_SELECTED

  - for each selected part
	- retrieve a list of possible transitions
	- retrieve current state and workflow information

  - group the parts with the same current workflow and state and load them
    into the form

  - highlight each part

  - if the user deselects a part, it will be added to the end of the original
    list of parts

  - load the possible transitions into the Next State field

  - if there is only one possible transition, highlight it
  
  - when the execute button is depressed

	- if no parts are selected
		- display error message
		- wait for input

	- if the next state has not been selected
		- display error message
		- wait for input

	- for each part
		- move the part
		- if status != SUCCESS, display error message
		- set the state
		- deselect the part on the PDM Utilities form

	- display status message

  - process and display next group of parts


  Algorithm for buttons on the Move State form:

  Select All Button:
	- select/highlight all parts in the mcf

  Deselect All Button:
	- deselect/unhighlight all parts in the mcf

  Cancel Button:
	- delete form
	- display message PDM_E_CMD_CANCELLED
	- display PDM Utilities form

  Help Button:
	- display help


  Form Changes:

  - add move to next state button to PDM Utilities form
