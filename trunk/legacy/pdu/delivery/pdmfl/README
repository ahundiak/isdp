Getting Started

PLEASE NOTE:

        There are some commands that do not work by keyins nor
        by I/Form interface.

        To resolve this problem, the file

        /usr/ip32/pdu/config/english/messages/PDUcommand.msg

        must remain in English. By doing this you will at least
        be able to access those non-functioning commands through
        the I/Forms interface.


Product Areas Not Translated:

        PDU Commands
        DB Access Error Messages
	EMS Error Messages
        NFM Error Messages
        Text strings on gadgets that must remain in English because of
           source code dependencies in the product. Ex. (State of files
           in List Local Files Palette - Checked In) 
        
Product Removal:

	When FLS_PDM is removed the english version will be returned
	to the I_PDU and I_PDM products.


Product Dependencies:

	The FLS_EMS product must be downloaded for the PDU Help Buttons  
        to work properly.
