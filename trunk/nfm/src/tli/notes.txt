This is the very low level routines used by nfm to establish socket connections.

When I link it it, nfm hangs on file transfer

net_client(): Entering to become client of 'willow'
mkclient(): Entering .. node: willow, port: 1585
mkclient(): made client fd: 15
net_write(): Entering to send 16 bytes on 15 (fd)
net_write(): Leaving sent 16 bytes on 15 (fd)
net_read(): Entering to read 16 bytes on 15 (fd)
net_read(): Leaving read 16 bytes on 15 (fd)
net_client(): Leaving became client fd: 15
net_write(): Entering to send 16 bytes on 15 (fd)
net_write(): Leaving sent 16 bytes on 15 (fd)
net_write(): Entering to send 24 bytes on 15 (fd)
net_write(): Leaving sent 24 bytes on 15 (fd)
net_recv_size(): Entering to receive size on fd: 15
net_read(): Entering to read 16 bytes on 15 (fd)

Only becoming a client of willow ie the local machine
Assume the local machine is talking to NFMdaemon, is it really doing anything?
