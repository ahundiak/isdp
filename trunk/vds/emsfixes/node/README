These files were generated while debugging a file saving problem.  Various print statements
were added for tracing.  Checked these in just to keep track of them for future use.
No intent to actually deliver these.

module.sleep controls the overall process sending a 
global_class.sleep message to each of the module objects.

The GRgsmgr was crashing while looking for undelete objects to clean up.  But this was
a side effect of the real problem.  There is a memory leak in there that should be 
fixed as well.

The super_para object sends an NDsleep message to all NDnode which includes all macro
objects.  This is where all the macro library nonsense comes in.

It also makes a collector object "usr:Colldefobj" which stors a list of objects
and os numbers) for objects waiting to be recomputed.  These are stored in a global
structure called NDmodif.  Might be useful to see what end up in there.

	   for (i=0;i<NDmodif.nb_obj;i++)
	   {
	      sprintf(attrname,"obj%d",i+1);
	
	      strcpy(objcoll[i].name, attrname);
	      objcoll[i].desc.type = AC_ATTRIB_TEXT;
	      sprintf(objcoll[i].desc.value.att_txt,"%d %u", NDmodif.list_id[i].objid, NDmodif.list_id[i].osnum);
	   }
