Back to doing some stand alone programs.
Added light weight dom interface library

17 May 2001

Stand alone programs are now using enough of these files such that it has
become a pain to individually link them.  So, a complete vdiah.o file is now being
built.  However, it is still not being delivered to the service pack.  No source has
actually been changed.

We really don't want to deliver VDgbl.c with the pack but do need it for standalones.

Probably need yet another directory for files required for pload and standalone but not
service packs.  Or else just temp copy it to the stub directory and keep it in sync.

Need some files such as VDgbl.c to be compilied for standalone programs.
But, do not want them in the service pack since reloading the static data
would be a bad thing.

First thing is to modify the makefile such that a service pack
build does not copy the vidahc.so file into the SPV.

This allows the creation of the various .o files which are directly linked
by the standalone programs.

When we do need to deliver a service pack .so, I think we need to create the
library directly in this directory by adding the necessary command to the makefile
then copying it to SPV.
