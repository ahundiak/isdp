                     I/CABLE database load.

  This directory ($CABLE/config/data) contains a number of
  ASCII files to facilitate loading of the sample database
  tables.

  There are three groups of files.

    1.    *.ddl       Data definition files, declaring table
                      layout for the underlying commercial
                      database package.
                      (DO NOT CHANGE THESE)

    2.    *.ris       Control tables for the VDSloaddata
                      program.

    3.    others      Data tables to be loaded in the DB.

  The tables are loaded using the VDSloaddata program with
  the menu option -VDS_SUPPORT_TABLES-

  All three actions are supported as follows:

  -CREATE & LOAD-  Input the path to this directory and the
                   appropriate pair of control files.

                   e.g.  all.ddl  and  allld.ris will create
                         and load all cabling tables.

                         conduit.ddl  and  conduitld.ris will create
                         and load ONLY the conduits and backshell tables.

  -LOAD-           Input the path to this directory and the
                   appropriate control file.

                   e.g. allld.ris or conduitld.ris

  -DELETE-         Input the path to this directory and the
                   appropriate control file.

                   e.g. allrm.ris or conduitrm.ris

  To be sure that a clean set of database tables is present perform
  the following actions.

   1.   DELETE ALL.
        DELETE option with allrm.ris as control file.

        Note: disregard error messages when attempting
              to delete non-existent tables.

   2.   CREATE & LOAD ALL
        CREATE & LOAD option with all.ddl and allld.ris as
        control files.

        In this case the programs question to delete old
        components is obviously superfluous.
