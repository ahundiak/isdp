    Format for this file:
    [1] The file contents should be sandwiched between flow_check and
	/flow_check (both being enclosed within a less than and greater
	than symbols).
    [2] Each entry should begin with a less than symbol, "part_check". This
	may then be followed (in any sequence) by -
	(a) pdm_part_num="string"
	(b) cpt#="STRING" where # is the cpt index and "STRING" is either
	    "IN" or "OUT" or "BI" (to indicate flow in to/out
	    of/bidirectional respectively).
	- and then terminated with a greater than symbol. This is
	immediately followed by a less than symbol, /part_check and a
	greater than symbol.

    NOTE:
    [1] If the flow against a cpt is given as BI, it is not checked for
	consistency of flow with its adjoining correction.
    [2] If the indicated part number corresponds to a correction-component,
	it is not checked for.
