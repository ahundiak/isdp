README file for SGI setup

   The SGI.Xdefaults file should be added to the user's $HOME/.Xdefaults
   file.  This file specifies the resources that need to be set up in
   order for I/EMS to behave reasonably with respect to color,
   save/restore forms, etc.  The user should make sure that his/her
  .Xdefaults file does not redefine any of these resources.
