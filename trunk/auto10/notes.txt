Starting fresh under impd04.  Try using automake to make dloadable files.

svn -m ah  mkdir https://isdp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/auto10 --username ahundiak@gmail.com
svn checkout https://isdp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/auto10 isdp/auto10 --username ahundiak@gmail.com

Copied Makefile.nbx from auto directory

Created nbx project using existing C/C++ sources with Makefile.nbx

Under projects it looks okay except for Important Files.

But creating notes.txt did not show up when under project.

*** Cannot copy/paste between NetBeans and gvim?

=============================
Deleted netbeans project
File - New project - C/C++ Project with Existing Sources
$HOME/surce/isdp/auto10 from existing sources
Custom configuration mode
Existing makefile Makefile.nbx
Uncheck clean and build
(Also a configure script option but don't have a configure yet)
Working directory $HOME/surce/isdp/auto10
Changed build/clean to just make
Source files : no changes
Code assistance - leave at automatic for now
Project Name: auto10
Project Location: $HOME/surce/isdp/auto10 (ended up with auto10 under auto10)
===
Deleted project, extra auto10 went away
Rebuilt with $HOME/source/isdp for project directory
Ended up with auto10-Makefile.mk and nbproject but okay for now.
