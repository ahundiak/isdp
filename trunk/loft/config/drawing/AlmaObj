#	Strudel file to process an edge attribute macro.  This file checks the
#	type of attribute, selects the values that are required from the list
#	in the box input (parent) collection of the macro and prints these in
#	the already open output (*.ini) file.
#
#	This file should be changed by customers to reflect their internal 
#	use, eg for adding annotations to object which is being processed, 
#	these annonation will be written in the Alma neutral file .  This file
#	 is ONLY an example of how annotation information could be written. 
#
# 	INTERGRAPH cannot provide in the standard I/LOFT release Strudel files
#	 which meet all the different customer criteria.  Please refer to the 
#	Strudel language documentation in the I/STRUCT and I/LOFT products.
