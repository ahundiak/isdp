Reviewed again, still do not want to
check in the changes.

Most of the fixed stuff is in here
$ mv VDatVerLike.c VDatVerLike.c.fix

Did check in
VDefpSrfComp.C
Changes the like tolerance from 1.0 to 2.0 to match like checker
And added various trace statements

Appears to be two fairly serious problems in the like parts routine

1. When adding a new piece to a group, not always check each member.  Assume a,b,c form
group 17.  Piece x is a potiental member.  Piece x does not match piece a so it should not be in the group.
However, piece x might match piece b.  The error was that b and c would be checked but piece a was not rechecked.
So piece x would be added even though it did not match piece a.  Rare but it happens.

2. Second problem was that the not like command was being ignored when checking to see if a piece could be added
to a group.  So if everything else matched, end up with groups containing not like parts. I think this was more serious.
Need to determine the extent of the problem.  Need to ensure what will happen when the correct grouping
algorithim is implemented.

Unit/zone 3372
PC 404 has a bunch of non-planar plates
How did the group get built?
Clear and re generate using the original .so
PC became 243, they no longer grouped together
Does this mean that the group was built by pre 262 code?
Reset piece mark and ran verify.

Piece got added into pc239 group.  Need to review generate vice verify.
Just for grins, ran validate.  Validate picked up the problem.


Question: How pervasive is this problem.  The original Validate will pick it up.

Tracking down problem in which verify followed by validate results in changes

M VDatInfo.c      Flag to grab geometry info for standard pieces
M VDatStd.c       Added type 8 for wt_col_fb
M VDatValidate.c  Tweaks to send standard pieces through checker
M VDefpSrfComp.C  Print statements

Piece Mark 2 - The story continues

Use this directory to store all the dom pcmk oriented stuff pulling in routines
from the pcmk and cmd directory as required.  Eventually, the pcmk directory
should go away.
