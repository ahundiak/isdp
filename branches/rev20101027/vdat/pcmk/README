This directory is now obsolete.
The makefile has been turned off
Couple of ppl's moved to pcmk2

These have now been integrated in sp14. made a big mistake because
pcmk.e was the master standard piece mark generator ppl stored in ../ppl.

So we broke standard piece marks.  Fortunately, another problem (collars vs clips)
arose and we discovered themistake before shipping.

Decided to bring the pcmk.u from ppl to here.  Did not really fit in ppl anyways.

Added a listing routine for dumping out the pice mark table.  

Planning on adding one to sync the table using the dump data.

Also wrote an independent standard piece mark testing routine.  Decided to check
it in as well.

A routine for checking too see if only one StagingTree exists and if so returning it's name
was added as part of this.  This routine is called by most unit testing code.  Might
want to move it somewhere else later.  But for now, this is as good of a place
as any.

Files copied from earlier spx directory.
Probably should match those in the pload?

Never been delivered in a service pack.

However, test21 is now a useful test.

And want to migrate the existing like parts stuff to
deal with area better.

Need to add to sp14.
