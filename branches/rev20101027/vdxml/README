Want to parse the spades xml file but it contains very long edge_curve attributes
Current structure has a fixed length of 128 characters for attribute value

Good news is that the internal parser uses a single working buffer for storing data
It is now dynamically allocated to a size of 100K.

Have not look real close but I don't see a spot for included data.

The parser is being used in a number of spots.  Changing the info structure
would not be a good thing.

Try the idea of using versions and clone the entire parser.

Try to group all the xml/pdf/cvg/sms stuff here.
All the files are .C to make it easier to call from a standaalone program.

Don't put any om/ems/isdp specific code in these file else wont
be able to link outside of vds
