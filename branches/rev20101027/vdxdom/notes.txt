Trying to put together a simple xml schema which
can be saved as a part 21 file.

First try in test2 involves keeping the entity names as the xml node
names and setting flags to indicate step information such as 
entity vs list.

Another approach would involve have a small set of predefined
step element names and then adding schema information as 
attributes.

See how that works.
