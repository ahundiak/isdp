Needed a utility to generate a NFMenv.dat entry.  I was setting up a new
twr database.  I know there was a utility somewhere but I don't know
where it is or how to use it.

Easy enough to write my own.

I had a few other nfm utilities written.  One to dump the NFMenv.dat
file and one to reveal schema passwords.  Can't seem to find the source.

So started a new directory and will check the stuff in here.

Note that the actual nfm utilities library is under vds/vdris/c and
is mixed in with some ris stuff.

Started by rebuilding nfmx_list main routine.  Really just two lines.
