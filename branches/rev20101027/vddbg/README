DIregexp.C:	The function DImulti_step has been modified to track
-----------	the character '\202' that corrupts the system.

		This modif has been done because of a TR (179417260) but
		has never been integrated but we keep the correction in
		case we have the same pb later.

		The problem was that some elements weren't recognised by
		name because of some handler (invisible) characters in the
		subdirectory system (instance buffer).

ciexinstr.C:	This function allows to see more for debugging files
------------	which are calling ppl macros. It display the name of
		the macro (file_name).

showctx.I:	During the locate process, all objects arte checked with
---------	the existing contexts. This method GRgetinstance() is 
		calle, whenever they like to check the context.
