 
  Drawing Extract Frame system Pattern.
 ------------------------------------

  This document illustrates the command usage and userinterface to extract
  the drawing frame system to the following types of patterns. 
 
  The following patterns can be requested and generated, using the locate
  filter for all desired objects.
 
  The following patterns are requested for output:
 
       PATTERNS:               FACTOR(1)               Factor(2)

       Remarks:
               All pattern are having an option in displaying the height of
               the symbolic representation of the frame object.
 
       Input Requests:
 
               o Select list of drawing objects.
               o pattern type  [1,2,3,4]       : default [1]
               o Primiariy frame factor [5,10] : default [10]
               o plane factor  [1,2]           : default [1]

			Pattern 1 & 2 are the requested patterns for Royal
			de Schelde. Type one of the patterns or move-on to
			accept pattern 1.


		prompt:		Give Primairy Frame Factor (5,10)[10] / Move-on

			An optional prompt for the patterns 1 & 3. Here, the
			user can specify where to display the frame number 
			with the primary frames.

				Factor(10)		Factor(5).

		prompt:		Give display factor (1,2)[1] / Move-on

			The line length is flexible. It can be set to one or
			two times the text height. Using this with the pattern
			1 and 3 will result in three different frame lengths.

		prompt:		Process Objects / Reject

			The setting is displayed in the status field and
			the user can accept this setting for processing or
			restart the interface processing.

	Associativity:
		
		The objects will maintain there representation after any
		recompute of the objects.
