                        CREATING DRAWING VIEW FROM PLANE
________________________________________________________________________________

        This document explains the working of the I/VDS command "Create 
        Drawing View From Plane". Details on command usage can be found in 
        On-Line Help or I/VDS Reference Manual. First going through the 
        On-Line Help or the I/VDS Reference Manual for this command, would 
        help in a better understanding of this document.


        To create a drawing view from a plane, the minumum inputs that have 
        to be provided by the user are :

           - A plane in a reference (model) file
           - A data point for placing the drawing view


        The resulting drawing view is controlled by several parameters, 
        which can be modified by the user, using the Status Display Form. 
        These parameters are :


           - view volume      : Defines the clipping polygon of the drawing
                                view.  The view volume is determined by the
                                values for "Range From", "Range To" and the
                                "Z depth" values on the Status Display Form.
                                The "Origin" is the point specified relative 
                                to the model space coordinates, and corresponds
                                to the data point located for placing the
                                drawing view.


           - view orientation : Defines how the original view has to be 
                                oriented to create the drawing view.  The 
                                orientation is determined by the values for 
                                the "Horizontal Axis", "Vertical Axis", and 
                                "View Vector" fields on the Status Display 
                                Form. 
                                The horizontal axis, vertical axis and 
                                the view vector correspond to the x, y and 
                                z directions of the selected plane, used to 
				define the view volume. A value of (0 1 0)
				specified for the Horizontal Axis means that
				the y axis of the original view has to be
				rotated to coincide with the horizontal axis.


           - scale            : The factor by which the drawing view has to be 
                                scaled with respect to the original view. A
                                scale of 2:1 will result in a drawing view that
                                is twice the original view size.


           - offset           : The distance by which the view volume is offset
                                in the direction normal to the plane.


        How the command works :
        ---------------------
        (In the following discussion, assume that the design file is "dwg" and
        the reference file attached to it is "ref")

        The design file "dwg" is brought up, "ref" is attached to it and the 
        command is invoked. Once the plane is selected (from the reference 
        file "ref"), the default values for the parameters are computed.  The 
        user can modify the parameters after invoking the Status Display Form.  

        The elements that will be picked for creating the drawing view are
        those that fall within or on the clipping polygon, in the context of
        the reference file, "ref".  In other words, if we bring up the 
        application, and retrieve the file "ref", and look into the volume
        enclosed by the clipping polygon, then we see all the objects that 
        will occur in the drawing view.
	The clipping polygon is defined by the view volume limits, the 
	z depth values and the offset distance. So, for creating the drawing
	view, a view is first created in the reference file based on the
	clipping polygon, and then transformed to the master file coordinates. 
        The drawing view is created and displayed according to the view
	orientation and scale values specified in the form.

        After the drawing view is created, the display depths of the window
        are modified and set equal to the display depths of the clipping
        polygon.  These depths would be the z depth values in the Status 
        Display Form, scaled by the scale factor and offset by the active 
        z depth of the window.  The modification of the z depths of the 
        window has been introduced to solve locate problems during drawing 
        extraction.

        If more than one drawing view is created in the same window, then the
        z depths of the window will be determined by the latest drawing view
        created.  In order to extract elements based on a previously created
        drawing view, first use the command "Set Display Depths from Drawing
        View" to activate the display depths based on that drawing view, and 
        then do a drawing extraction. 



        In the case of multiple reference files attached to a design file, the
        situation is more complex and is discussed below.

        Multiple Reference Files 
        ------------------------
        When multiple reference files are attached (either directly or as
        nested files), the following question arises :

                "Which elements do we pick for the drawing view?"

                        in other words,

                "In which file should we create the initial view for 
                 picking elements?"

        There are different ways in which the reference files can be setup;
        the ones relevant to this command are discussed below. The following 
        is valid for all the cases.

                        DRW         - Design file
        
                        ASSEM       - Assembly file 
                                __
                        FILE1     |
                        FILE2     |
                                   >- Reference files
                        FILE3     |
                        FILE4   __|

                The plane to be identified for the command is in reference
                file FILE1.


        DIFFERENT SETUPS OF REFERENCE FILES :
        ------------------------------------

        1) Single Reference file attached to design file.

                              +-------+
                              |  DRW  |
                              +-------+
                                  |
                              +-------+              
                              | FILE1 |              
                              +-------+              

           Initial view created in FILE1


        2) Multiple reference files attached directly to the design file.



                              +-------+
                              |  DRW  |
                              +-------+
                     __________|  |  |__________
                    |             |             |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+
                | FILE1 |     | FILE2 |     | FILE3 |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+

           Initial view created in FILE1


        3) Multiple files attached to an assembly file which is attached to
           the design file. Plane present in nested reference file.


                              +-------+
                              |  DRW  |
                              +-------+
                                  |
                              +-------+
                              | ASSEM |
                              +-------+
                     __________|  |  |__________
                    |             |             |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+
                | FILE1 |     | FILE2 |     | FILE3 |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+

           Initial view created in ASSEM

        5) Assembly file present.  Plane present in nested reference file.


                              +-------+
                              |  DRW  |
                              +-------+
                                  |
                              +-------+
                              | ASSEM |
                              +-------+
                     __________|  |  |__________
                    |             |             |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+
                | FILE2 |     | FILE3 |     | FILE4 |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+
                    |__________   |  ___________|
                               |  |  |
                              +-------+              
                              | FILE1 |              
                              +-------+              

           Initial view created in ASSEM

        5) No assembly file. Multiple files with nested reference files
           attached to design file.  Plane present in nested reference
           file.


                              +-------+
                              |  DRW  |
                              +-------+
                     __________|  |  |__________
                    |             |             |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+
                | FILE2 |     | FILE3 |     | FILE4 |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+
                    |                           |
                +-------+                   +-------+
                | FILE1 |                   | FILE1 |
                +-------+                   +-------+

           In this case, we cannot identify a unique reference file, in
           which we can create the initial view.  Both FILE2 and FILE4 are
           equally eligible.  If we choose both, it would result in two
           different drawing views : one with objects selected from FILE2 
           and FILE1; the other with objects selected from FILE4 and FILE1.
           This kind of result with two drawing views, is not desirable.
           Hence this case is treated as an invalid setup of reference files.
           An error message is displayed and the command restarts without
           creating any drawing view.


           This case has been generalised to determine whether a particular 
           setup is invalid or not as follows :

                If a design file has more than 1 reference file directly
                attached to it, 1 or more reference files indirectly
                attached to it (nested files), and the plane identified 
                belongs to a nested reference file, then the setup is 
                treated as invalid.



           The above generalisation would treat the following setup too
           as invalid, even though it is possible to create a single
           drawing view.


                              +-------+
                              |  DRW  |
                              +-------+
                     __________|  |  |__________
                    |             |             |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+
                | FILE2 |     | FILE3 |     | FILE4 |
                +-------+     +-------+     +-------+
                    |     
                +-------+
                | FILE1 |
                +-------+



      The results can be summarised as follows :
