Fixed up the makefile to work
Not really sure what the original issue was

20 Jan 1998 - Art Hundiak

As checked in, the makefile did not work.
Makes no sense to have a .I file and no .S file.
Should be converted to a .t setup.

Since the command was not to be used anyways,
I just renamed the makefile and the .m file.

Fix later if we need it.
