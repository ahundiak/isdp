The PPLs VDit_route.u, VDit_struct.u, and VDit_vds.u are used to generate 
the mat_id_key for various objects.  See the comments section in the PPL for 
which type of objects.  These PPLs are required to support the newly added
functionality of exposing attributes from various database table to OPE
functionality such as create formatted text.

The PPL VDit_attrs.u is used to determine where the attributes are to be found.
It contains the necessary queries used to get attributes.


All of the PPLs are customizable.  If a customization is done, they will need
to be compiled and the resulting .e files should replace the existing files of
the same name is $VDS/ppl/bin.
