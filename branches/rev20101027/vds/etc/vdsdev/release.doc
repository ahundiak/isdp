                        -------------------------------
                        Releases of I/VDS - 2nd edition
                        -------------------------------


This memo is a revision of the proposal sent previously to improve the 
certification process of I/VDS releases.  The following sketch describes how
this process is organized : 



                ---------------------

Developpers area        vdsdev          latest integration
                        devcert         certified by developers

                ---------------------

3D modeling team        precert         pre-certification (temporary location 
							before certification)
                        vdscert         certified by the 3D modeling
                        vdspload        PLOAD release of VDS

                ---------------------



Five locations from which I_VDS may be got via "newprod -n" have been defined 
on the vdssrv server :

1) vdssrv.vdsdev.vdsdev, which contains the latest product files (at this date
        I/VDS 02.01.01.38), after the integration has been completed
        => updated by the integrator
        => clients :
		- developers
		- fetch to "devcert" by development
 
2) vdssrv.devcert.devcert, which contains the product files of a release
	certified by the development, BUT not yet certified by the 3D
	modeling team
        => updated by the development
        => clients :
		- developers
		- fetch to "precert" (pre-certification area) by 3D modeling 

3) vdssrv.precert.precert, which is a TEMPORARY area where the release is
	stored before certification by the 3D modeling
        => updated by 3D modeling team only
        => clients : 
		- 3D modeling team in order to certify the release
		- fetch to "vdscert" by the 3D modeling

4) vdssrv.vdscert.vdscert, which contains a release CERTIFIED by 3D modeling
        => updated by 3D modeling team
        => clients : 
		- 3D modeling
		- customers
		- fetch to "vdspload" by 3D modeling

5) vdssrv.vdspload.vdspload, which contains the PLOAD release of I/VDS
        => updated by 3D modeling team
        => clients : 
		- 3D modeling
		- customers
		- CD-ROM

Note 1 :
------
	The fetch of product and their initialization is done by running the 
	same script shell named incr_vds.sh

Note 2 : files organization of a server location
------

	vdssrv.xxxxxx 	.profile

			ws_s/	vds
				struct
				route

			bin/	initprod2
				incr_vds.sh
