The Associated vdtvwtools.h file contains some routines for use with regards to node 
manipulation and string list manipulation that may be of considerable use. 

They include the memory allocation for these lists in such a way that the user may add 
to or subtract from lists without regard to these allocation issues except that of freeing
the memory when done.

The tools include some text box tools which can allow the user to load a text box without
regards to order or any content duplication and then by one action present the text box
associated list unique without any duplicates and if desired in order of ascending or 
descending ascii value.  

There is a test which can be use to determine if a text string is in fact a number and 
not a string containing alpha data. 

There are fast ways to filter some list values.

These tools should speed development considerably if used.
