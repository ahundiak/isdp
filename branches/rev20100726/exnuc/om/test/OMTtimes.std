			NOTE

This file contains the average of results from the following
timing tests: OMTsend.C OMTsend51.C OMTcdtime1.C OMTcdtime2.C.
The results recorded here are from both the time command
and the timex command. These average times should be 
recomputed with each release to ensure that no unreasonable
reduction in speed has occurred.
