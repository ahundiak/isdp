copyOS

NAME

	copyOS - make a copy of an existing OM object space


SYNOPSIS

	copyOS old_os new_os


DESCRIPTION

	The copyOS utility is used to make a copy of an existing object space.
	The utility will only accept two arguments.  The old_os must be an
	existing object space.  The new_os can either be a filename or a 
	directory.  If new_os is a directory,  then the destination will in
	effect be <directory>/old_os.

	A plain UNIX copy (cp) has been used to accomplish this in the past and
	has created problems.  Each object space has a unique internal name 
	that is assigned when the file is created.  This internal name is used
	to provide a means of identifying related object spaces.
	When one object space refers to another, it stores the other object 
	space's internal name.  This name must be unique.  The problem with 
	UNIX copies is that the internal name does not get changed and the 
	uniqueness factor is lost.  The copyOS utility provides the user with 
	the ability to copy an object space and automatically change the
	internal name.

	Any reference file that was attached to the original file will remain
	attached to the new file.  If this is not desired then the user must
	call the file up and manually detach the reference files.


EXAMPLE

	copyOS wheel.dgn wheel2.dgn

	copyOS wheel.dgn /usr/tmp

	  Note that the above example would create the file /usr/tmp/wheel.dgn
