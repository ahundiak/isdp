                          ---------------

OVERVIEW
--------

    Menubuilder is a tool that can be used to generate the three types
of menus which are used by the Menu system of X/FORMS.  These are 
Panel Menus, Bar Menus, and Popup Menus.

    Menus are actually X/FORMS that only have button gadgets on them.
There is also some special menu information that is set for menu buttons
that cannot be set using the Form Builder utility.  Hence the need for
this new utility.

    Bar Menus consist of a single row of buttons, usually displayed at
the top left hand corner of the display.  Panel Menus consist of a
number of cascading levels of buttons where each level of buttons is
referred to as a palette.  Four levels of palettes are allowed.
Finally popup menus consist of a matrix of buttons.  The popup menu
is displayed wherever the mouse button used to call it up was activated.

MENU BUILDER COMMANDS
---------------------

Define Menu - This command is used to load in existing menus for 
              manipulation or for the creation of new menus.  When the
              Define Menu form is displayed, you may select a directory
              to search for menu files.  The current directory is
              displayed by default.

              Once the directory is selected, Menu builder examines
              all files in the directory and filters out all non-menu
              files.  Unfortunately, it is not smart enough to display
              only the top level palette of a panel menu.  It will
              display all of its sub-palettes as well, because they
              are also stored as forms and recognized as being valid
              menus.  

              To create a new menu, instead of selecting an existing one
              from the list of options, key in the name of the new menu.
              You will then need to choose the type of the menu.  Note:
              you cannot change the type of an existing menu.  It must 
              be set when the menu is created.

              You may elect to change the size and location of the menu.
              If the menu type is a popup menu, you must decide how many
              rows and columns of buttons will appear in the menu, as well 
              as their size.  If the menu type is a panel menu, you will
              need to specify the button sizes for each of the four
              levels of buttons.  A standard button is provided to set
              standard sizes for the four button levels.

              The button sizes must conform to a set of rules.  These
              are that the number of buttons in each row must decrease
              or stay the same as palette levels increase.  Also the
              height of the buttons in a row must increase as palette
              level increases.  The menu builder enforces these rules
              as you key in values for the various button levels.

Save menu -   This command lets you save the menu being edited to a file.
              (or files, in the case of a panel menu)  The Save Menu
              command differs from the exit command in that you will
              be allowed to continue modifying the menu after this
              command.  The operator is given the option of creating
              a genmenu format ascii file that describes the menu.

Add button -  This command acts differently depending on the menu type.
              The bar menu will resize all buttons on the menu, making
              them small enough to allow room for the new button on the
              end of the row.

              The popup menu will add a button to the end of the last row
              of buttons in the menu.  If that row is filled, a new row
              will be started, if room is left for one.  If no room is
              left in the menu, then no button will be added to the
              popup menu.

              The panel menu will prompt the operator to select a button.
              It does this because it needs to know what palette you wish
              to add a button to.  A button will be appended to the end
              of the last row in the selected palette.  If there is no 
              room left in that row, then a new row will be started and
              all palettes that are displayed below the current one will
              be shifted downward to accomodate the new row.

Cut button -  The operator is prompted to select a button.  The selected
              button will be deleted and placed in the paste buffer.  If
              the last button in a Menu panel row is deleted, then any
              palettes below that level will be shifted up to fill the gap.
              If the button that is deleted had palettes attached then
              they will be deleted as well.

              Note that since the button to be deleted must be visible,
              you must be sure to display the palette containing it
              before activating the cut button command.  You can select
              a palette in the menu builder the same way that you would 
              in your application.  Just select the button that calls
              up that palette.

              Note also that the cut buffer only contains the LAST
              button deleted.  If you delete three buttons before pasting
              the first two are gone for good.

Swap Button - The operator is prompted to select two buttons.  The selected
              buttons will trade places in the menu or palette.  For
              panel menus, the buttons must be located on the same palette. 

Edit Button - The operator is prompted to select a button.  The operator 
              is allowed to choose whether a button displays text or
              a symbol icon.  If text is selected, the text will be 
              displayed in the swiss742b.15 font.  The operator is allowed
              to key in multi-line text that will be displayed in the
              button.

              Alternately the operator can choose to display a symbol
              icon in the button.  In this case he must specify a 
              symbol file and symbol index.  To aid in selecting a 
              symbol, the operator has two sub-forms that can be brought
              up from the edit button form.  The symbol selection form
              displays 16 symbols at once and has buttons to scroll
              through the entire 256 symbol range.  The symbol directory
              form allows you to add search directories so that the
              Menu Builder will be able to locate symbol files.  In the
              current release this information must be entered each time
              the Menu Builder is run.

              The operator can also decide what type of command will be
              generated when the menu button is pressed at run time.
              There are three possibilities, one of which is limited
              to menu panels.  Command strings and command keys are
              usable by any menu type.  The operator specifies a
              string.  If it is a command string it will be used as is
              in the application.  If it is a command key, the application
              will have to perform a UMS lookup to determine the string
              associated with the command.

              Menu panels have a third option.  You can specify that 
              a button bring up a sub-palette instead of issuing a command.
              If this option is specified then a palette containing a
              single row of buttons will be created at the level below
              that of the button being edited.  You can also choose to
              change a button from being a palette button to being a
              command button.  In this case the sub-palettes attached
              to the button will be lost.

Paste Button - This command is used to restore the last deleted button
               to the menu.  The button will be appended to the end of 
               the last row of buttons.  In the case of a Menu Panel
               it will be added to the displayed palette which is
               of the same level that the button was cut from.
 
               If the menu button caused a palette to be displayed,
               then this information will be recovered as well.

               If the menu is a popup menu, and there is no more room
               for the button to be placed on the menu, then the paste
               operation will be aborted.

Preview outline - This command displays a spreadsheet of information
                  about all buttons on the menu.  It allows one to
                  quickly modify the command strings and text/symbol
                  definitions for the buttons on the menu.  The operator
                  is not given the opportunity to change a palette
                  button into a command button or vice versa in this
                  command.

                  The palette that a button belongs to as well as
                  its level is also displayed.  This information is
                  for review only and may not be changed by the operator.

Exit Menu Builder - This command will exit from the Menu Builder program.
                    If a menu is currently being edited, the operator
                    will be given an opportunity to save it out before
                    exiting.   Also the operator will be given an
                    opportunity to save the file in ASCII genmenu format.

UNSUPPORTED COMMANDS
--------------------

Define Set-up - When the operator selects this command, he will be shown
                an "under-construction" box.  This command is supposed to
                be analagous to the Form Builder's set default values
                command.  

                Some items that might be incorporated at a later date:

                   A list of symbol directories to search
                   Default on and off colors for menu buttons
                   a standard font for text buttons

                We are open to suggestions at this stage.

Help - The XForms based Help subsystem was not completed at the time
       of this release.  So when the operator selects this command
       he will be shown an "under construction" box.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
-------------------

Although the Menu Builder is capable of generating an ASCII genmenu
outline file, it is unable to load this file.  Instead it only loads
in X/FORMS files though the Define Menu command.
