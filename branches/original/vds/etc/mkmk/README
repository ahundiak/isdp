This code was originally copied from the exnucsrc directory.  
It had to be reompilied to work under Solaris 8 though I forget
exactly why.

When the gnome stuff started, a 15 character filename limit was encountered.

reduce_pth.c was moodified to raise the limit to 63 characters.

And the code was finally checked back into cvs.  Should get deleted
once the project for rebuilding the entire system is completed.
