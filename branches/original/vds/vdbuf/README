The basic idea is to have a object with just some vlas for storing data.
Might store this data in xml format.
Derive new objects by combining VDbuf with common objects.
Thus giving old objects unlimited data storage capabilities.

Nice theory but will it work.

Initial tests are positive, xxx will change the class of existing objects,
data can be added and retrieved.  Still need to do lots of testing.  Make sure
nothing breaks if an object whose components are being attached to from another
file is changed to a VDbuf object.

But for now, get the new classes checked in.
