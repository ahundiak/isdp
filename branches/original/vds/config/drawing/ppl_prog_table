This is a file to contain a list of ppls that are to have access automated with information
The percent sign will indicate a particular ppl then following it the text will contain the actual
ppl name and then a command name for that ppl "COz_evalExp" would be the actual ppl name and a space 
then the text "Evaluate Node By Expression" would be the command name

After this the file would have a series of dependent description lines each preceeded by a pound sign
These would describe the ppl in more detail terms

% COz_evalExp "Evaluate Node By Expression"
# Enter node osnum and objid 
# Enter Expression name
#
# This expression will then evaluate
# the node and present its results
# for this and all child nodes under
# the selected node.
