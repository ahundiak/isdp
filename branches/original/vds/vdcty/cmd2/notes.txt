VDct1Root.c
  Commented out the various init routines
  VDctyGetFilter()

VDct1Test.c
  VDjt1FindTreeByTypeName(&workJD,0,VDCT1_FIND_SET_OPT_ALL_FILES,
			  setType,setName,&treeJD);

  VDjt1FindTreeByTypeName(&workJD,0,VDCT1_FIND_SET_OPT_ALL_FILES,
			  setType,setName,&treeJD);

In many cases, don't yet have a node but we want to call base routines

Make it up to the calling routine?
Or try calling base tree by default?

VDct1Mgr.c
  VDctyGetFilter(NULL,NULL,nodeID,&cmdInfo->classList);
  Makes sure manager object is available
  Reset Gadget

Added isStandAlone to cmdInfo to control response processing

VDct1Box.c - No changes but probably need to actually implement

VDct1Set.c
static IGRstat changeNodeSetName(TVDct1JD *nodeJD,
				 IGRchar  *setName)

Need to implement SetBaseInfo
Need to implement Add attribute

Need to implement for each tree
getSetTypeInfo

Need a means to cycle through list of available sets suitable for creation
Or else do something else.  But a simple list for now would be good.
Maybe a flag or something.
