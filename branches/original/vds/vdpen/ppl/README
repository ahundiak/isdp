Penetration macros stuff

total package has 18 files

6 source ppl's, 6 compiled ppl's

	2 are placement ppl's pen.u and pcg.u
	2 are cimacros COpenMacro.u and COpcgMacro.u
	2 are modify ppl's COpenMod.u and COpcgMod.u
	
	really all that is needed is the 6 *.e files,
	these need to be local to where you are working 
	or in a product/ppl/bin directory.
	
2 forms
	pen.frm is the form for pen.u and penMod.u 
	pcg.frm is the form for pcg.u and pcgMod.u
	
	these files need to be in the local directory
	or in a product/config/english/forms directory.
	
1 macro library
	penLib this can be renamed to anything you want but has to be attached to
	the file that you are working in. This macro library has the simple macros
	round (rd), flat oval(fo) ... and the cimacros in it. This file
	has to be local or in a product/ppl/bin directory.
	
1 ascii file named DeckList which will contain all of the decks that can be selected
	in the pcg.u and pcgMod.u commands. This file currently needs to be local.

1 README I hope you can figure this one out.
 
1 ncci this file is used to compile the ppl's outside of the product.
