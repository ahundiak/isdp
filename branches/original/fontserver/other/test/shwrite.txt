;		-NETMAP		07-SEP-1988
;		-Added the turn on/off sections to the Change Interval 
;		 Update menu. This is available for the Node Configuration 
;		 display.
;		-Activated the refresh, cover, and collapse events when Netmap 
;		 is waiting for the user to hit the middle button when the 
;		 cursor is over the raised X square.  Some examples of where 
;		 the raised X square are :
;
;	        for the Entire Network display
;	            - Statistics form
;	            - Help links form.
;	        for the Network Objects display
;	            - Help symbols form
;	            - Show Node Assortment form
;	        for the Remote Router Configuration display
;	            - the workstations help symbols form
;	        for the Bridge Communications Server display
;	            - the database dump form
;	-Display the 100 series of workstations and Q386 VAX/VMS nodes.
;	-Checking the node's Socket Database for the listener's sockets
;	 allocation.  If the socket is active the Node Configuration display
;	 will try to contact that listener.  When the listener's socket is not
;	 allocated the contact of that listener will be skipped.
;	-On the Bridge Communications Server display the user is allowed to
;	 change to Nodenames.
;	-On the Node Configuration display, Netmap will skip checking for
;	 specific properties in the Clearinghouse entry for the node when the
;	 XNS_listener doesn't even respond to an ECHO command.  The
;	 Clearinghouse properties which Netmap displays are Scope, NETMAP_info,
;	 Primary_User, Location, and Phone.
;	-Re-adjusted the Network Objects display to have wider right margins
;	 (TR # 88I0636 E).
;	-Changed "Re-collect data" to "Collect Data Again" in the Selections
;	 menu list for the Entire Network display. (wording changed not the 
;	 action)
;	-"Find Node on LAN" Selection option for the Network Objects display
;	 places an orange box or white box under the symbol.  This box will
;	 remain in the display until a refresh event of the Network Objects
;	 display or when leaving the Network Objects display for the Entire
;	 Network display or for another Local Area Network display.
;	-Able to show multilink connection on a Remote Router in the Remote
;	 Router Configuration display again.
;	-Showing thicker lines on the Entire Network display with multilink
;	 connections.
;	-Another compatibility problem can be seen with Netmap.  The router, as
;	 of the Oct 1987 through Feb 1988 release cycle, will recognize TOPAZ
;	 CPs as having the search network database.  There was a 1-Jul-1987
;	 release of XNSTOPAZ CP that did not have the capabilities to save the
;	 network node entries.  So when a router running CP code of Oct 1987 or
;	 later happens to use a 1-Jul-1987 XNSTOPAZ node as the database
;	 reference node for the Network Objects display, Netmap will return the
;	 "Could not access Local Area Network xxxxxxxx" message.
;	-Added CP protocols triangles to the connection lines of the Remote
;	 Router on the Remote Router Configuration display.  Also added a
;	 section at the bottom of the display to show what each CP protocol
;	 triangle represents.
;	-The Remote Router Configuration display will now draw as you watch.
;	 This is similar to the Bridge Communications Server display and the
;	 Node Configuration display.
;	-Added an Administration section at the bottom left corner of the Node 
;	 Configuration display.  This section will display the primary user's
;	 name, physical location, and phone number which is in the node's
;	 Clearinghouse entry.
;	-Changed the Nodename Scope section on the Node Configuration display to
;	 show the network number or nodenames in one column.  For more than 18
;	 entries in Scope four arrows will be provided at the side of the Scope
;	 section to allow the user to move though the Nodename Scope list.  The
;	 large arrows indicate movement to the top of the list and the bottom of
;	 the list.  The smaller arrows indicate the movement between pages.
;	-Displaying "Please Wait" box when finding a node on the Network Object
;	 display that requires a Clearinghouse cross LAN lookup operation.  It
;	 takes longer to lookup a nodename on another LAN.
;	-Changed the "Please Wait" box which displays when changing to nodenames
;	 on the Network Object display.  It will now indicate Clearinghouse
;	 cross LAN lookup operations and the address of the Clearinghouse
;	 database being used.  It takes longer to lookup nodenames on another
;	 LAN.
;	-When viewing the last page of the Network Object display the
;	 Communication Servers (if any were found) will be drawn in separately
;	 that is no longer a complete screen refresh.
;	-Place the cursor over the database section on the Bridge Communications
;	 Server display and tap the middle mouse button to get a list of all
;	 entries in the database.
;	-When specifying the Interval Update time from the command line a zero
;	 for the update time value will indicate no interval updates will take
;	 place.
;	-The user can specify interval updates to start from the Change Interval
;	 Update menu.
;	-No longer core dumps when no routers on the network.
;	-On the Entire Network display when there are only 2 LANs each only
;	 having 1 connection, they will appear in the center.
;	-On the Entire Network display the error message "At this time there are
;	 too many LANs to give an accurate display of their interconnections."
;	 will be displayed after the Status box (the box which contains the
;	 statistics about the collection of routers).  The message was previous
;	 displayed with each redraw of the screen.  It was mistakenly display
;	 with the case of 2 LANs each only having 1 connection.
;	-Added an options to the Bridge Communications Server display
;	 'Selection' list.  The "Change Database" allows the user to specify a
;	 different node on the LAN to receive the Bridge Communications Servers
;	 database for display.
;	-Placing the cursor over the third section in the Bridge Communications
;	 Server display and tap the middle mouse button to get the dump of the
;	 whole database.
;	-Corrected window name for the Node Configuration display of an
;	 InterServe.
;	-Corrected the symbol placing of IS200 (change in netmap.sym).
;	-No longer core dumps when freeing up the second Network Object
;	 display's data structures when the LAN doesn't contain Bridge
;	 Communication Servers.
;	-Fixed Netmap continuing to update when the window was collapsed.  This
;	 bug shows up when the collapse event occurred before the queued timer
;	 event could be serviced.  This may just have been wrong with the
;	 Jun 23, 1988 version of Netmap. 
;	-Including an intermediate symbol for the Remote Router Configuration
;	 display.  This symbol, a large question mark, will be used for the
;	 remote node until the node is contacted (successfully or
;	 unsuccessfully).  If the port is active but there isn't a connection
;	 to it (an address of ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff in the routing database), the
;	 large question mark will not be erased.  The large question mark 
;	 definition is displayed in the help strip at the bottom of the window
;	 for the Remote Router Configuration display.
;	-The help file has been updated to reflect the changes made to Netmap.
;	 Netmap Listener has been added to the Glossary.

;	-Activated the refresh, cover, and collapse events when Netmap is 
;      	 waiting for the user to hit the middle button when the cursor is
;        over the raised X square.  Some examples of where the raised X square
;        are :

;              - Statistics form
;              - Help links form.

;              - the workstations help symbols form
;	-Display the 100 series of workstations and Q386 VAX/VMS nodes.
;	-Cking the node's Socket Database for the listener's sockets allocation.
;        If the socket is active the Detailed Node display will try to contact
;        that listener.  When the listener's socket is not allocated the contact
;        of that listener will be skipped.
;	-On the Detailed Bridge Communications Server display the user is
;        allowed to change to Nodenames.
;	-On the Detailed Node display, Netmap will skip checking for
;        specific properties in the Clearinghouse entry for the node when the
;        XNS_listener doesn't even respond to an ECHO command.  The CLH
;        properties which Netmap displays are Scope, NETMAP_info, Primary_User,
;        Location, and Phone.
;	-Re-adjusted the Nodes on the LAN display to have wider right margins
;	 (TR # 88I0636 E).
;	-Changed "Re-collect data" to "Collect Data Again" in the Selections
;        menu list for the Entire Network display. (wording changed not the 
;        action)
;	-"Find Node on LAN" Selection option for the Network Objects display
;        places an orange box or white box under the symbol.  This box will
;        remain in the display until a refresh event of the Network Objects
;        display or when leaving the Network Objects display for the Entire
;        Network display or for another Local Area Network display.
;	-Able to show multilink connection on a Remote Router in the Detailed
;        Remote Router display again.
;	-Showing thicker lines on the Entire Network display with multilink
;        connections.
;	-A compatablity problem can be seen with Netmap.  The router, as of
;        the Oct/87 thru Feb/88 release cycle, will recognize TOPAZ CPs as
;        having the search network database.  There was a 1-Jul-1987 release of
;        XNSTOPAZ CP that did not have the capablities to save the network node
;        entries.  So when a router running CP code of Oct/87 or later happens
;        to use a 1-Jul-87 XNSTOPAZ node as the database reference node for the
;        Network Objects display, Netmap will return the "Could not access Local
;        Area Network xxxxxxxx" message.
;	-Added CP protocol triangles to connection lines of the Remote Router
;        on the Detailed Remote Router display.  Also added a section at the 
;        bottom of the display to show what ea CP protocol triangle represents.
;	-The Detailed Remote Router display will now draw as you watch.  This is
;        similar to the other two detailed displays.
;	-Added an Admin section at the bottom left corner of the Detailed
;        Node display.  This section will display the primary user's name, 
;        physical location, and phone number which is in the node's CLH
;        entry.
;	-Changed the Nodename Scope section on the Detailed Node display to show
;        the network number or nodenames in one column. For more than 18 entries
;        in Scope four arrows will be provided at the side of the Scope section
;        to allow the user to move though the Nodename Scope list.  The large
;        arrows indicate movement to the top of the list and the bottom of the
;        list.  The smaller arrows indicate the movement between pages.
;	-Displaying "Please Wait" box when finding a node on the Network Object
;        display that requires a Clearinghouse cross LAN lookup operation.  It
;        takes longer to lookup a nodename on another LAN.
;	-Changed the "Please Wait" box which displays when changing to nodenames
;        on the Network Object display.  It will now indicate CLH cross
;        LAN lookup operations and the address of the CLH database being
;        used.  It takes longer to lookup nodenames on another LAN.
;	-When viewing the last page of the Network Object display the Comm
;        Servers (if any were found) will be drawn in seperatly - no longer a 
;        complete screen refresh.
;	-Place the cursor over the database section on the Bridge Communications
;        Server detailed display and tap the middle mouse button to get a list 
;	 of all entries in the database.
;	-When specifying the Interval Update time from the command line a zero

;     -Included the Bridge devices in the update pass on the Network Object
;      display and the Bridge Communications Server display.
;     -No longer printing the Non-router Node Configuration messages in the
;      message strip when the display is the Bridge Communications Server
;      display.

Jan 8, 1988

;    -When there are no workstation on the network (the Network Objects 
;     display) the protocol section on the Show Node Assortment menu was
;     displayed below the menu.
;    -Show/Hide Updating split into 2 entries - it is now consistant with
;     Start-Cancel entry pairs and Usage-Free entry pairs in other pull-down
;     menus.  (Now documented that way in netmap.hlp)
;    -When requesting a Cancel Updates, Netmap will cancel after the network
;     call has complete - not when all the network calls required for the
;     update have been completed.  You can now cancel the update in the middle
;     of an update not only at the end of an update.  (Now documented that way
;     in netmap.hlp)
;    -Allow the user to enter Help eventhough not all the Network calls are
;     complete.
;    -Printing the Last Update date on the Bridge Communications Server display
;     when the month is January.
;    -When Netmap attempts to transmit a network call before the last one
;     completes Netmap will develop problems with every network call.  I
;     have put in a block so this domino effect of network calls 
;     does not spread has it has done.  I complete fix of this problem
;     will be dealt with in the next release.  The problem is tied into the
;     speed of display changes and Netmap's speed to response to display
;     changes which will be dealt with in the next release.
;     -RTC.SH,RTS.SH,TTE.SH,RMTDSK.SH
;     -this product no longer responsible for creating /dev's.
;      devices will be handle by the kernal from here on out per
;     -D.Kirkland's request.(see him if the necessary devices are not found.)

;	DATE  : 11-DEC-1987
;	-CLH_MMI	08-DEC-1987
;	-CLH_SERVER	08-DEC-1987
;	-DODINI		08-DEC-1987
;	-new image for initializing lower layers of TCPIP and NFS.
;	-FMU		08-DEC-1987
; 	-On Unix, set uid and set gid bits are not propagated when 
;	-transferring files.
;	-On Unix, the character '~' is valid in a file name.
;	-On Unix, user's .profile is executed prior to starting FMUS.
;	-Incorporated optical disk support for FMU and FMUS.
;	-FMUS		08-DEC-1987
;	-INCMON		04-DEC-1987
;	-Amethyst and clipper nodes will have the address of a node on the 
;	-network which has the network search database.
;	-Two new entries for the General Statistic menu, Signal quality error
;	- and the percent CP usage of the CPU.
;	-Because of the new entries on General Statistic menu page 1, the 
;	-second page now contains No carrier sence signal and DMA transmit 
;	-failure counters
;	-Added more to the incmon command line error message - because inc.hlp
;	- is going to disappear.
;		-*Programer's Note
;	- General Statistics display may flip between different display formats
;	-when the nodes being examined has cp code older than September 1986.
;	-INITTAB.SH	04-DEC-1986
;	-KERMIT		08-DEC-1986
;	-NETMSG		09-DEC-1986
;	-Fixed blank user, nodename, and message problem.
;	-NETMAP		10-DEC-1987
;	- Putting remote router on the no response router list so they can not
;	- be displayed or accessed twice during the Entire Network collection.
;	-Added search for BRIDGE devices.  It is done after the nodes on the 
;     	-LAN is displayed and before the update of the Network Object code.
;    	- Choosing collapse icon will deactivate the process (a fix in tools
;    	library -corrected the problem)
;    	- Network calls are now async.  During Network send/rec, graphic events
;    	serviced are Delete window, Keyboard input (control-C or control-Z) and
;    	Menubar events (Help, Selections, Exit).  Between network calls Collapse
;    	window and Button events are serviced.  Refresh window event is serviced
;    	after network collection is complete.  
;    	- Programmer's Note
;    	Control-Z does not work when run from terminal off AUX port.
;    	- When NETMAP is brought up collapsed the information for the first 
;	display is collected at a less privileged system priority.
;    	- No longer displaying Warning Box when couldn't contact a port off the
;    	Remote Router, simple relaying on the No Reply box symbol.  Chose of the
;    	No Reply box symbol will generate another try to contact the remote node
;    	- Interval Update of information.
;    	The menu displayed upon chose of "Selections" from the menubar now
;    	contains the option 'Change Update Interval'.  You may reset the time
;    	between updates, Cancel/Start the updates, and Show/Hide the updates.
;    	From the command line you may preset the interval update time by using
;    	-i followed by the time (in seconds).  The default is 10 seconds.
;    	The Show/Hide option will either show which object is currently being
;    	contacted in the update process or not show it. The showing of an object
;    	is just drawing a yellow or white rectangle around it.  On the Entire
;    	Network display the rim color of the ellipse is changed rather than
;    	drawing a rectangle.
;    	- Tap the right button when the cursor is in the NETMAP window will show
;    	the PEP timeout value and the time between interval updates in the
;    	Message Strip.  Tap the right button again to return the button
;    	usage message.
;    	- New to the Selection menu is "Change B&W/Colors".  This is a toggle of
;    	the colors in NETMAP to change to black and white mode or color mode.
;    	This is helpful for printing existing data to a v80 type ploter.
;    	 New to the Selection menu on Local Area Network display (display of 
;	nodes on the LAN) is "Show Node Assortment" which shows the number of 
;	each type of node on the network.  It also counts the number of nodes 
;	which are only XNS, XNS and ISO/OSI, XNS and TCP/IP, or XNS, ISO/OSI, 
;	and TCP/IP.
;    	The Workstations in this display are showned by their CP type then the 
;    	actual hardware workstation symbol follows it.
;    	- An intermediate Selection menu is established when changing between
;    	displays and network collection is involved.  This allows the user to
;    	use the Exit or HELP besides the Selections.  The Selections available
;    	are Change Timeout, Change Interval Update, and Change B&W/Color.
;    	- Cross LAN lookup of nodenames fully implemented now.  We can only hope
;    	they have the clh_server over there by now.
;     	- ISO/OSI and TCP/IP are now indicated at the connection line on the 
;	Local Area Network display (display of nodes on the LAN).  TCP/IP is a 
;	triangle above the node connection line.  On color displays, this 
;	triangle will be red or intense violet depending on the number of 
;	colors configured for the screen planes.  A triangle below the node 
;	connection line indicates the node also running ISO.  On color 
;	displays, this triangle will be brown of intense green depending on the
;	 number of colors configured for the screen planes.
;     	- The number fonts are larger.  The number of workstation symbols have
;    	been increased to better identify the physical node type rather than 
;	just the type of CP the node is running.  There are new symbols for the
;	Unibus, Qbus and BI CPs.  A MicroVax symbol has been added.  The 
;	InterMap Analytic symbol was also changed.  Bridge Communications 
;	Server symbol was added. The 'Help-Symbol' option on the menubar of a 
;	Local Area Network display will identify the symbols - if you have them.
;     	- The Entire Network display now has dashed lines to indicate half 
;	duplex or full duplex links between LANs.  Wider lines indicates more 
;	than one link.  Solid lines indicates a 10 Magabit link.
;     	- Added to the menubar on the Entire Network display "Help-Links" which
;    	list the line styles and their definitions.
;     	- Pressing the Left button when the cursor is over a LAN symbol on the 
;    	Entire Network display results in a list of addresses of the routers
;    	on that LAN.
;     	- Showing Entire Network collection process.
;    	As the routers are polled, in the collection for the Entire Network
;    	display, a router symbol and its address is displayed.  An 'X' over
;    	the router symbol indicates that router did not respond.  This could
;    	indicate that the router has just gone down and has yet to be removed 
;	from all router databases or that the PEP timeout was set too low.  If 
;	the router symbol turns into a 'WS' then the address indicates a remote
;    	workstation.  After the collection of router information, a statistics
;    	box will appear on the screen which requires a middle botton tap for
;    	acknowledgement before drawing the Entire Network display. 
;     	- On the Entire Network display when the Right button is pressed the 
;	time values are shown as well as changing the display to better see 
;	connection lines and line styles.  This will help to show the links 
;	destination when the line brushes by another LAN symbol.
;     	- The LAN symbols in the inner circle of the Entire Network display will
;    	now have their line connection points at the two end points of the 
;	ellipse not the center of the ellipse.
;     	- During the update of the Local Area Network display (the display of 
;	the nodes on the LAN) an 'X' over the nodes symbol indicates that no 
;	response was received from that node when it was polled.
;     	- The Remote Router Configuration display now shows Uptime, Free Space,
;    	Image, and Version name for the router and each node connected off the
;    	router.  During the update of this display zeros for Uptime, Free Space,
;    	Image, and Version name are indications of no response from node when
;    	polled.
;     	- Added to the Remote Router Configuration display is a screen button
;    	to enter RTM (Remote Router Management Function).  To have this screen
;    	button add -a to the command line. ("a" stands for Adminstrator)
;     	- Added Non-router Node Configuration display.  It shows some CP
;    	information, currently running listeners, clearinghouse scope, and some
;    	system statistics.  Tap the middle button when the cursor is over the CP
;    	section to spawn incmon.
;     	- Added -l option to the command line.  When -l <network number> is on 
;	the command line the display will bypass the Entire Network display and
;	display the network specified.  If the network number specified on the 
;	command line was a cluster network number the the display will be the 
;	Remote Router Configuration display otherwise the display will be the 
;	Network Objects display.
;     	- Change to the new UNIX subdirectories off of /usr/ip32/inc.
;     	- If there are no routers on the network, the network number is zero, 
;	then Entire Network display will not exist.  There will only be the 
;	Local Area Network display (all the nodes on the network) and the 
;	Non-router Node Configuration display.
;     	- Added search for BRIDGE devices on the Local Area Network display. 
;	It is done after the nodes on the LAN are displayed and before the 
;	update of the the display.  Netmap will be slow to move between the 
;	pages while it is search and receiving the BRIDGE device database.
;     	- The Non-router Node Configuration display of a BRIDGE device consists
;    	only of the address and version number of the devices and the address of
;    	the node which has the database and the date and time the device was 
;	last heard from.
;     	- Time displayed in the second line of the message strip will have
;    	the format Day Mon dd, 19dd hh:mm:ss.
;     	-Programmer's Note
;      	Netmap is dependent on the libtools_s exicutable being up to date (at
;      	least October 29 works but Sept. 21 didn't).
;	-RLOGIN		08-DEC-1987

;	-Added rc file support.
;	-Added the N option which causes the rc	script to be ignored.
;	-Added the Z option which, when	specified with the P TELNET 
;	-option, indicates that <CR> is to be converted	to <CR><NUL>, 
;	-instead of the default	<CR><LF>, before transmission to the
;	-remote node.
;	-Added OPTIONS command support.
;	-Modified the technique used to search for the "escape to
