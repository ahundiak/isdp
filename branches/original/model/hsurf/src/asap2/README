THE ASAP2 DIRECTORY:
	Contains everything necessary to create a version of the
tiler suitable for microcoding on the ASAP2.

TO CREATE A TILER FOR MICROCODING:
	Run the shell script "make_tiler."  It will bring in the
necessary source files, create a makefile, make the library and
cleanup.  The name of the library is "tiler.o."

TO CHECK EXTERNAL REFERENCES FROM TILER.O:
	Run slmod.  Give any header, say "tmp."  Give no .sl or
import.h files.  Give hsurf_global.o as the global .o file.
Don't bother to check the types of unknown variables.  Give
"tiler.o" as the .o file.  The extern file, in this case
"tmp.extern." will give all the external references.
	If you find a new external reference, you need to deter-
mine whether or not it's really needed.  If it's not, surround
the reference in the .c file with "#ifndef MICROCODE" and "#endif."
That will eliminate the reference from the microcoded tiler.
	If the new external reference is needed by the microcoded
version of the tiler, be sure to let Lew Brodnax know so that he
can make sure the reference gets into the microcode.

TO CHECK THE PROGRAMMING INTERFACE:
	Compare the functions in "HSasap_intfc.c" to their
counterparts in other directories.  Be especially sure that the
argument lists match.
