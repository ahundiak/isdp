Product:        DELTOOLS                Delivery Tools
Version:	07.06.05.00
Date:		03-NOV-1997
Description:    DELTOOLS contains utilities which install software
                products from Intergraph CD/ROM distributions, keeping
                track of what versions of what products are delivered
                to each node.  An ASCII installation tool (newprod) is
                provided, and there are also utilities to create disk
                delivery nodes (makenode), remove products (remove),
                and various commands that display information about the
                system and application configuration (prodinfo, proddata,
                dates, Free, etc.). Support for unattended remote installation
                is provided through remote_newprod.

Getting Started
---------------
You must have superuser ("root") privileges to use the "newprod" and "remove"
DELTOOLS utilities.  Other utilities such as "dates", "Free", etc.  do not
require superuser privileges.

Newprod now uses TCP/IP as its primary connection protocol to CLIX
delivery nodes.  XNS protocol is used only for network connections to
VAX delivery nodes, or if the TCP/IP connection step fails for some
reason.  Before "newprod" can be used to connect to a CLIX delivery
node using TCP/IP, the following configuration steps should be performed:

1) The workstation must have a valid internet address assigned to it.
   If the machine does not have an internet address assigned to it,
   contact your system administrator.

2) The "newprod" service must be registered on the system before newprod
   can be run.  If your system does not have this service registered,
   perform the following steps:

   To add this service on a system that is not using NIS (Yellow Pages),
   edit the /etc/services file and add the following line:

  newprod       608/tcp              # Newprod delivery service

   If your system *is* running NIS/YP, find out the name of the machine
   that is the master of the services map:

   # ypwhich -m services

   Have the administrator of that machine edit the /etc/services file
   as shown above and then perform the following steps:

   # cd /etc/yp            (The directory is /var/yp if the master is a Sun)
   # make services

   The services map will then be updated and "pushed".  Use the 
   command "ypcat services | grep newprod" to verify that the 
   entry has been added to the database.

3) To allow the node to act as a delivery server, make sure the
   following line is in the /etc/inetd.conf file.  (On SGI workstations,
   the file is located in /usr/etc/inetd.conf):

On Intergraph and SGI workstations:
 newprod stream tcp  nowait  root    /usr/ip32/deltools/delserve delserve -t

On Sun workstations:
 newprod stream tcp  nowait  root    /usr/bin/delserve delserve -t

    Next, perform a "kill -HUP" on the inetd process to force it to
    re-read the inetd.conf file.

Migration Notes
---------------

IMPORTANT!

Beginning with this version of DELTOOLS (07.06), serial numbers can be
used for extraction of products from CD-ROM. There are no changes to the
existing load key procedures.

Beginning with this version of DELTOOLS (07.05), a new method of
loadkey delivery is being implemented.  Loadkeys will be delivered by
Intergraph Software Distribution on a separate CD-ROM, and DELTOOLS will
now ignore any loadkey information that may exist on current product
CD-ROMs.  Before installing software from product CDs using this version
of DELTOOLS, you should be sure that you have extracted loadkeys for
your system from the loadkey CD-ROM using the 'getcdkeys' utility.
Products on older CD-ROMs can still be installed, but the updated
loadkey information will be necessary to get access to the product.

The 07.05 version of DELTOOLS also introduces a change in the protocol
used between "newprod" and the "delserve" delivery daemon in order to
support longer product part numbers.  The new 07.05 "delserve" delivery
daemon will work properly with older "newprod" clients, but the 07.05
newprod client *must* operate with the 07.05 delserve.  To migrate
smoothly to 07.05 DELTOOLS, be sure to update all your delivery servers
*first*. Then your workstations can be upgraded to 07.05 DELTOOLS.


The information in /etc/inetd.conf used by the "delserve" delivery
server daemon is different in release 07.00 and later.  In earlier
releases, the daemon would be invoked with "-t" as the command name.
This led to confusing information in process listing output.  This
has been fixed in the 7.00 release; however, if you must install an
older release of DELTOOLS after having installed this release, you
will need to change the "inetd.conf" information back to its original
form in order for the "delserve" daemon to be invoked properly:

INETD.CONF settings for 6.x and earlier versions of DELTOOLS:

On Intergraph workstations:
 newprod stream tcp  nowait  root    /usr/ip32/deltools/delserve -t

On Sun workstations:
 newprod stream tcp  nowait  root    /usr/bin/delserve -t

New Fixes
---------
---------
    Version 07.06.05.00
    ===================
    Problem:
    Deltools was not Year 2000 compliant.

    Solution:
    Fix incorrect handling of 2 char year field in newprod.
    Fix incorrect handling of 2 char year field in vprod.
    Fix incorrect handling of 2 char year field in xvprod.


    Version 07.06.04.00
    ===================
    Problem:
    o [TR 289600769]
    delserve printed the connection username/password in the log file.

    Solution:

    Removed the password from the debug output in delserve.c.


    Version 07.06.03.00
    ===================

    Problem:

    Fix made in previous version did not work for serial numbers found in
    snfile.

    Solution:

    Change fix made in previous version to work for serial numbers found in 
    snfile.


    Version 07.06.02.00
    ===================

    Problem:

    Newprod allows any valid serial number to extract any product.

    Solution:

    Fix the problem.

    Version 07.06.01.00
    ===================
    o [TR 289409289]

    Problem:

    Remote_newprod cannot retrieve the defaults file from the system
    listed in the MODEL keyword.

    Solution:

    Fix made to delserve in 07.05.17.00 was inadvertently left out of 
    07.06.00.00.    


    o [TR 289500882]

    Problem:

    Deltools install script fails on systems with multiple ethernet cards.

    Solution:

    Code that was required only for Clipper systems, to determine the
    presense of a TCP address, was removed for other platforms.


    o [TR 289500998,289500999]

    Problem:

    Remove utility failed to work when products installed in a location other
    than the default or "ingrhome" directories.

    Solution:

    Changed the remove script to obtain the location of the installed product
    from the "ingrinit" file.


    o [TR 289404763]

    Problem:

    Need a bootstrap for deltools on SGI systems.

    Solution:

    The startup script included and documented on Intergraph CD's now 
    recognizes all platforms supported by Intergraph. 

    To "bootstrap" deltools from the network, do the following:
	ftp newprod.'platform' to the system.
	chmod 755 /'PATH'/newprod.'platform'
	ln /'PATH'/newprod.'platform' /'PATH'/bin/getfile.  Ensure that
		'PATH' is defined in your PATH environment variable.

	Add the following entry in your system's \"services\" 
	database (either the /etc/services file, or the NIS/NIS+ database):

	newprod         608/tcp                 #Intergraph S/W Delivery

	Execute /'PATH'/newprod.'platform' -n 'delivery-node-address' to
	download the deltools product.


    o [TR 289503370]

    Problem:

    Newprod sometimes fails to find a serial number that has been entered
    into the snfile.

    Solution:

    Fixed a flag that indicated to only search the loadkey file for this entry.


    o [TR 289500148]

    Problem:

    On Intel-Solaris the "Free" utility does not always perform its test 
    for file system space correctly.  It will sometimes look in "/" for the
    free space instead of the true mount point of the directory in question.
    This can cause installation of the product to fail.                  

    Solution:

    Corrected logic in "Free" so it determines the mount point of        
    the directory in question, then performs an exact comparison         
    of that mount point with the file systems in the table.              
    

    o [TR 289301650]

    Problem:

    On SUN-OS If the .prods file has 2 products listed in it that refer to
    both clipper and sun, the next product you add will cause makenode to     
    core dump.  If you do not have 2 products that are both used by sun  
    or clipper you can load as many products as you wish with no problem.

    Solution:

    Code was continuing to traverse a linked list even after desired 
    information was found, and pointer was freed and set to NULL.


    o [TR 289502871]

    Problem:

    On Intel-Solaris, DELTOOLS makes an incorrect entry in /etc/inetd.conf
    when installing on INTEL_SOLARIS.  The first field needs to be
    delimited by a tab, not a space in order to be able to
    newprod or makenode products from the INTEL_SOLARIS machine.
    I changed the entry manually, and things began to work fine.         
    filed per Dave Blalock B30 SW DEV. 

    Solution:

    The field may actually be either a tab or blank.


    o [TR 289303261]

    Problem:

    Deltools remove on the SGI platform is looking for the file          
    $INGRHOME/$i/proddata (where $i is nqs).  An error is                
    generated and the product is not removed.  Also, remove looks        
    for /usr/bin/fmli (which is not the location on the SGI box)         
    instead of searching for it.                                         

    Solution:

    "remove" now looks for proddata in the correct place, and            
     determines where it should look for FMLI based on the platform       
     type.


    o [TR 289404528]

    Problem:

    On SGI-IRIX, The INGRHOME environment variable does not work for the 
    CATALOG utility and the default file name is incorrect. The utility 
    exits with the message "Couldn't open catalog file".

    Solution:

    Catalog now uses INGRHOME, and if not defined, defaults to the correct
    path.


    o [TR 289500686]

    Problem:

    Deltools (delserve) no longer passes correct key information         
    back and forth with VAXPROD.  Currently the DELTOOLS on the          
    workstations deals with 21 character load keys while DELTOOLS        
    on the VAX only understands 19 character load keys.                   

    Solution:

    Software Distribution will generate 19 character load keys for
    VAX products.


    o [TR 289302044]

    Problem:

    On SGI-IRIX, The Ingrinit command does not use the PRODDIR variable
    correctly resulting in /usr//ingrconfig.  

    Solution:

    Ingrinit now sets and uses the PRODDIR variable consistently.


    o [TR 289303066]

    Problem:

    When loading a product on SUNOS which requires a load key, you sometimes
    receive an error saying that the load key is not valid. 

    Solution:

    Newprod passes the name of a file in the product directory to the 
    load key verifier.  The buffer newprod used to hold this pathname     
    was too short if the product's README file was "README.sun" and      
    it was a newer CD-ROM with SWD's new directory structure. The Buffer
    has been enlarged.                                                   


    o [TR 289301337]

    Problem:

    On SUNOS, the Free command reports 122% used space on a 2.1 GB drive 
    with a file system being the whole drive.                                   

    Solution:

    Variables used to hold free space and total space have been expanded 
    to unsigned long.  


    o [TR 289302147]

    Problem:

    On GSX systems, the "inqgra" utility does not return a value.
    It should return the value "S3928" for a Genesis system.

    Solution:

    Added new SYSINGR calls to detect number and type of S3 graphics     
    adapters.


    o [TR 289303226]

    Problem:

    Using newprod on SGI machine, select 'f' to list the available       
    file systems.  You will get a "Trace/BPT trap" error and newprod     
    is exited.                                                           

    Solution:

    "newprod" was not excluding all the file system types it should have 
    from the parsing of the mount table.                                 


    o [TR 289303788]

    Problem:

    The install script for Intel-Solaris contains an error which causes
    the following problem: The script tries to find a ypserver and if it 
    cannot it prints messages notifing the sys admin to make a change to 
    the master NIS server sevices file. If the system is not running NIS
    the verbose messages are not needed, and should not be output.

    Solution:

    The code at line 135 was changed as follows:
	if [ -x /usr/bin/ypwhich -a /usr/bin/ypwhich ]                       
	ypwhich > $NULL 2>&1                                                 
	if [ $? = 0 ]
		....


    o [CR 289202535]

    Problem:

    When you use the command "newprod -?" on a sun system, the menu
    which appears will tell you the default for the -b basefs arg is
    /usr. This is wrong it should be changed to /home
 
    Solution:

    Changed usage message to reflect the proper "base fs" on each
    platform.


    o [CR 289203561]

    Problem:

    Vprod should be deliverable with it's shared libraries to a server.

    Solution:

    Install procedure now allows installation of VPROD and XVPROD on     
    systems that do not have graphics hardware.                          
    Install script does not check if server -dwh 09/29/95                


    Version 07.06.00.00
    ===================

    o [TR 289500706]

    Problem:

    Remove on SGI platform hangs trying to use FMLI, which is not
    available.

    Solution:

    If we're running on SGI platform, then only use CLI interface.


    o [TR 289406046]

    Problem:

    "cdprof" malfunctions when working with a Load Key database that
     contains more than 4369 product IDs.

    Solution:

    Expanded sort table size variables to unsigned long and reworked the
    sort/merge code.


    o [TR 289304290]

    Problem:

    CD-ROM sometimes had to be manually unmounted following a <control-c> abort
    command.

    Solution:

    Moved the signal handlers to immediately after the CD-ROM was mounted.

   
    o [TR 289404844]

    Problem:

    inqscsi fails to recognize tape on 68xx systems.

    Solution:

    The inqscsi utility used the TEST_UNIT_READY command which caused the
    tape controller to hang. The utility was rewritten to eliminate
    the TEST_UNIT_READY command.


    o [TR 289501263]

    Problem:

    newprod -r 'xnsaddr' caused newprod to crash.

    Solution:

    Buffers for the XNS protocol transfer had not been allocated.


    o [CR 289301291,289303524]

    Problem:

    Ingrinit creates multiple entries in ingrconfig when nfs mounts
    have been done for other nodes.

    Solution:

    Changed "find" statement to use flag to exclude NFS mounted file systems
    from the search that Ingrinit uses to fine "product.dif" files.


    o [CR 289404535]

    Problem:

    Delserve needs to honor ftp "LOCK" passwd field during 
    user authentication.

    Solution:

    Delserve changed to check the appropriate flags in the
    audit database for locks.


    Version 07.05.16.00
    ===================
    o [TR 289201548]

    Problem:

    Loadkey decryption fails if the /usr partition is almost full.

    Solution:

    Check for sufficient space in /usr before attempting to do loadkey
    verification initialization. A warning is issued if there isnt enough
    space.

    o [TR 289409579]

    Problem:

    Install procedure for CLIX systems gave incorrect instructions for
    updating the "/etc/inetd.conf" file for the "delserve" daemon.

    Solution:

    Corrected the stated location of the "delserve" program in the message.


    o [TR 289409539]

    Problem:

    "getcdkeys" utility sometimes hangs on SGI systems.

    Solution:

    Changed method used to find the profile database files on the CD-ROM.


    o [TR 289500148]

    Problem:

    "Free" utility sometimes mistakenly tests the root file system for
    free space instead of the file system that actually contains the
    directory to be checked.  This can lead to erroneous reports that
    there is insufficient disk space to load a product.

    Solution:

    Fixed "Free" to get the exact mount point of the directory in question,
    then compare that exactly against the list of file systems and their
    free space.


    Version 07.05.15.00
    ===================

    Added the same support for an "interfaces" file for SCO systems.
    They also have a range of supported ethernet interfaces which we
    must support.


    o [TR 289409289]

    Problem:

    remote_newprod fails when trying to retrive "MODEL" information.

    Solution:

    Insure that remote_newprod's "proxy" service on the remote system
    is correctly setting its network request "revision" number when
    connecting to "model" system.


    o [TR 289409098]

    Problem:

    "Initial" does not search the complete directory tree for "product.def"
    files, because of recent changes in "makenode" delivery structure.

    Solution:

    "Initial" will now do a full search on each provided directory name,
    finding every "product.def" file.  For each file found, "Initial" will
    attempt to initialize that directory.


    o [TR 289406486]

    Problem:

    "vprod" is unable to delete an installed product.

    Solution:

    Made sure "vprod" set the PLATFORM environment variable, which
    is used to determine the name of the product removal script.


    o [TR 289304290]

    Problem:

    Intermittently need to unmount "/del" by hand before being able to
    eject the CD-ROM, if "newprod" was stopped by issuing SIGINT.

    Solution:

    Initialize signal handlers earlier in the "newprod" program so
    SIGINT handler is in place.


    Version 07.05.14.00
    ===================

    o [TR 289409016]

    Problem:
    
    On Intergraph CLIX systems, using XNS networking to install software
    from remote CD-ROM will not work; the newprod session will "hang".

    Solution:

    Made sure that "newprod sets the revision field in the request
    structure when making an XNS connection to "delserve".


    o [TR 289407848]

    Problem:

    Using the "makenode" utility to download a product that has versions
    available for both the Intergraph Environ V graphics environment and
    the X Window System causes problems (one overwrites the other) because
    the directory path that makenode creates for both versions of the
    product is the same.

    Solution:

    Instead of stripping out the "processor code" from the product part
    number when creating the directory path, it is now left in.  This
    insures that Environ V products (code "01") and X Window products
    (code "0J") get unique directories.


    o [TR 289408281]

    Problem:

    SCO DELTOOLS installation instructed users to modify their
    "inetd.conf" file with an incorrect pathname for the "delserve"
    executable.

    Solution:

    Corrected message printed during installation to reflect the correct
    location (/usr/ip32/deltools/delserve).



    Version 07.05.13.00
    ===================

    We are now using a 'generic' device node to refer to the CD-ROM
    device on Intel Solaris systems.  This new device node is
    "/dev/dsk/cdrom", and it should be created by the system
    administrator with the same attributes as the 'c?t?d?s?'
    node that Solaris uses to access the drive.

    The SPARC Solaris DELTOOLS will still use /dev/dsk/c0t6d0s2 to
    access the CD-ROM, since Sun maintains more consistency in the
    hardware configuration of their systems.


    Version 07.05.12.00
    ===================

    Since Intel Solaris systems have a wide range of possible network
    adapters that may be used, a new file "interfaces" has been added
    so we can add support for new adapters without recompiling code.
    (This file is used for Intel Solaris and SPARC Solaris only.)


    Version 07.05.10.00
    ===================

    A small change was made to the way 9 digit part numbers are
    "extended" to 15 characters.  9 digit numbers that end in "00"
    are now mapped to "AA" when being extended.


    Version 07.05
    =============

    Module:  ALL

    o [CR 289404638]

    The DELTOOLS utility suite has been modified to handle new
    distribution requirements.  Loadkeys are now delivered on a
    separate CD-ROM which will contain keys for ALL products and
    ALL authorized customers (on all platforms).  This loadkey
    information supercedes any loadkey information which may have
    been delivered on older product CDs.  (This version of DELTOOLS
    is still able to install products from older product CDs; you
    must have an up-to-date loadkey CD to provide the new 21
    character loadkey needed to unlock the product.)



    Module:  INGRINIT

    o [CR 289301291]

    Problem:

    Ingrinit follows NFS mounts, so multiple product entries may be put
    into the ingrconfig file.

    Solution:

    Use appropriate flags for the "find" utility to avoid traversing into
    remotely mounted file systems.


    Module:  INQSCSI

    o [TR 289300221]

    Problem:

    On Intergraph workstations with C400 processors, the "inqscsi"
    utility exits with a return status of 50 even when the command
    is successful (which should cause a return status of 0).

    Solution:

    Made sure that "inqscsi" explicitly returned a status of 0.


    Module: MAKENODE

    o [TR 289301107]

    Problem:

    When "makenode" is invoked without the "-b" option, the user is
    prompted for a directory to use to hold the products.  This exact
    directory name is used.   But when makenode is invoked with the
    "-b" option to specify the directory to use, the subdirectory
    "ws_s" is automatically added to the directory name, whether the
    user wants it or not.

    Solution:

    Handling of "-b" option now refrains from appending "ws_s" onto
    the given directory.


    Module:  NEWPROD

    o [TR 289300357]

    Problem:

    When too many characters are entered for a loadkey, newprod
    will abort.

    Solution:

    Newprod now reads the loadkey input into a large buffer, then
    extracts the appropriate number of characters for verification.


    o [CR 289201548]

    Problem:

    Loadkey verification fails if the /usr file system is nearly full.

    Solution:

    Newprod will check for sufficient space on /usr before beginning
    operation with CD-ROM.  



    Version 07.00
    =============

    Module:  SHOWCONFIG

    o [TR 92I3351, 92I3316]

    Problem:

    showconfig does not properly report information for X.25
    Dual T1 controller.

    Solution:

    showconfig.dat already has info for Dual T1 X.25 controller;
    the "showconfig -n" code did not look for that feature
    value.  It now includes the Dual T1 X.25 controller in its
    set of "valid" comm features, and reports the board in a
    way that "tcpconfig" will recognize.


    Module:  REMOTE_NEWPROD

    o [TR 92I2944]

    Problem:

    When using remote_newprod, it is possible to hang a target
    system by using up all of memory and swap space.  Problem
    occurs when LOGWHERE variable contains a "user@node" style
    address, and target machine does NOT have the SENDMAIL
    product installed or configured.

    Solution:

    Mail invocation has been modified to handle stdout and
    stderr more safely (redirected to /dev/null).  Fix requires
    new DELTOOLS to be installed on *target* nodes, not the
    machine controlling the "remote_newprod" process.

New Features
------------

o   Version 07.06 now supports serial number authorization for loading products
    from CDROM. There are no changes to existing loadkey procedures.

o   Makenode now implements a new directory structure for downloading
    products.  The structure is based upon the product number,
    the product architecture, and the major/minor version number of
    the product.  For example, Version 07.05 of DELTOOLS for CLIX
    workstations would use a directory path of

        {base directory}/SS040/CLIPPER/07.00

    Each platform's version of a product is now listed separately
    in the makenode menu, and the architecture name for the platform
    is listed in the description:

    DELTOOLS	CLIX Software Delivery Tools	07.05.00.00 .....
    DELTOOLS	SUN Software Delivery Tools	07.05.00.00 .....
    DELTOOLS	MIPS_IRIX Software Delivery To	07.05.00.00 .....
    DELTOOLS    SPARC_SOLARIS Software Delivery	07.05.00.00 .....


o "showconfig" recognizes the Intergraph series 2500 and 6800 systems.

o Newprod and makenode can now understand machine names specified in "Fully
  Qualified Domain Name" (FQDN) format by using the following syntax for
  the '-n' option:

                           user@nodename[:password]

  The following are examples of valid connection strings:

    wsdel@tigger.poohcorner.org        (account has no password)

    wsdel@tigger.poohcorner.org:       (newprod will prompt for password)

    css60@tigger.poohcorner.org:mypass


o "delserve" now has the ability to limit TCP/IP access to a delivery
  node through the use of access control lists.  There are two files
  that may be used to tailor the security of a delivery node:

  /usr/ip32/deltools/node/hosts.allow               (allowed clients)
  /usr/ip32/deltools/node/hosts.deny                (denied clients)

  Each of these files may contain the names of machines, domains, or
  networks to be allowed or denied.  These are examples of valid entries
  for the files:

     tigger                   (simple nodename, for systems that do not
                                  use DNS for host name resolution)

     tigger.poohcorner.org    (FQDN format, for systems that use DNS for
                                  host name resolution)

     192.0.0.1                (Specific Internet address)

     192.0.                   (Internet network number -- matches any
                                  address beginning with "192.0.")

     .poohcorner.org          (domain name -- for systems running DNS,
                                  matches any host in this domain)

     ALL                      (wildcard -- matches any address or host)


  When delserve receives a connection request from a newprod client, the
  files are searched according to the following algorithm:


     1.  Search for the host name and internet address in hosts.allow.
         If a match is found then allow the connection to proceed.

     Otherwise, 

     2.  Search for the host name and internet address in hosts.deny.
         If a match is found, then deny the connection.

     Otherwise,

     3.  Allow the connection to proceed.



o A new utility "catalog" has been added to assist users in the work of
  keeping track of different Intergraph product CD-ROMs and the products
  they have on them.

  Summary:

  catalog {-a | -d} | {product name} [product version]

      -a      Add information to the CD catalog file from a product list
              in "/del/ws_s.prods"

      -d      Delete products listed in "/del/ws_s.prods" from the CD
              catalog file.

      product name
              Name of product to search for in catalog (such as DELTOOLS)

      product version
              Optional version number of product to search for.  Partial
              version numbers are accepted, such as "06.01", or even "06."


  The program looks for a "volume" file on the CD-ROM to indicate the
  CD-ROM's title, release date, volume label, and inventory order number.
  This file will be included on CD-ROMs beginning with the ISS 07.00
  release. If this file is not found, the user is prompted to enter the
  information manually.

  The file that is used to store the CD information is
           /usr/ip32/deltools/cd_catalog

  An alternate file may be specified by setting an environment variable
  called CD_CATALOG_FILE that specifies the pathname of the alternate
  file.

TR #  289503470
        The RISCLI 5.2.2.56 will not successfully execute the getfile command
	for the c100bin.prod file.
	A workaround is available, so the priority of this TR has been lowered.
	The problem is that, for some reason, the getfile is returning before
	the file transfer is complete.

TR # 289503512
	When loading deltools (7.5.17) onto a TDx machine running Solaris 2.4
        a link should be made for the 'dates' command to the /usr/bin dir. By
        default the current link is made to /opt/ingr/bin and does not take
	into consideration that the cust may choose to load his IGR producsts 
        to a dir other than /opt (ie. /usr/ingr/). Since the link is not made 
        to /usr/bin (as it is when deltools is loaded to Clix nodes), the date
	command does not work, which hinders the proper loading of the RIS 
     	product  

TR # 289503513
	When customer tries to load a keyed product to a TDx machine running
	Solaris 2.4 locally, it works fine but when cust tries to load the
	same product from a remote TDx machine running Solaris (same ver of
	Deltools), the error msg appears:"incorrect loadkey". Even when load-
	key is keyed in manually, the same error message appears. WS# 5160561
