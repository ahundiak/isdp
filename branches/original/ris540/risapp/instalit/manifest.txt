INTRODUCTION
------------

RIS (Relational Interface System) is a generic relational
database interface.  RIS allows applications to access any
supported relational database system without modifying
source code.  RIS uses ANSI/ISO Standard SQL and also
provides networking capabilities to allow applications to
locate their data on one or more remote network nodes.
The development platform (RISDP) contains an embedded SQL
preprocessor for the 'C' programming language(riscpp) and
other include files and libraries for program development.
