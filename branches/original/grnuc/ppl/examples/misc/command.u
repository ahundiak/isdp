/************************************************************
 * FILE:  command.u
 *
 * PURPOSE:  This PPL program demonstrates three methods
 *    of calling commands in a PPL program:
 *
 *       1. use the prompts that Intergraph provides to get
 *          input
 *
 *       2. use your own prompts to get input
 *
 *       3. terminate the command within the PPL program
 *          instead of making the user terminate the command
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: This program calls the "place circle by
 *    center and radius" command three times.
