The following files should go into the following directories:

*.dat   	- are searched first in current directory, 
		  and then in -S/config/drawing/ProfCard.
	 	  directory. These are conversion tables.

		  in -S ppl/bin directory.
*.u, *.h	- PPL program source files.

graphicPc*,
textPc*    - should be put in -S/config/drawing/ProfCard directory.
	     These are STRUDEL programs.
	     
graphicPc,
textPc 	   - files in -S/config/drawing directory should have just an include line.

PCsetup.txt - should be put in user's $HOME directory.
