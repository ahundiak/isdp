 The inverse bending line and unfold commands will read this file 
 to know which informations, in addition to the structural element
 name, it should display on the 2D result.
 Wanted informations should be preceded by a '%' for the inverse bending
 line command, and by a '#' for the unfold command.

 example :

attributes for the inverse bending line command :
% att1        the first attribute
% att2        the second attribute
% att3        the third attribute

attributes for the unwrap command :
# att4        the first attribute
# att5        the second attribute
# att6        the third attribute


 The search order for this file is the same as the setup strudel files :
                        ./setup
                        <user-path>/config/drawing/setup
                        $LOFT/config/drawing/setup
                        $STRUCT/config/drawing/setup
                        ...
 The first setup file found will be interpreted.
