Product:	I_STRFEM   	Intergraph STRUCT-FEM Converter
Number:  	SM0XXXXX
Version:	02.06.03.00
Date:		26-APR-2002
Description:	The Intergraph STRUCT-FEM (I/STRFEM) Converter is a computer-
		aided engineering ( MCAE) product that converts 
		structural elements of I/STRUCT design file to fem elements.
		The fem elements thus obtained can be used by I/FEM product.

General Information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This product is built on top of I/STRUCT and I/FEM. So both the products
need to exist on the system.

About the  commands
===================

    The file containing STRUCT elements should be attached as reference file
    to the main file. FEM elements will be created in main file. The attachment
    should be updatable. If either STRUCT elements are not in reference file or
    reference file attachment is not updatable, user will be notified of
    the same at the time of conversion.

Convert Plates for Analysis :

o   This command converts STRUCT plates to FEM plates.


Convert Beams for Analysis :

o   This command converts STRUCT beams to FEM beams.

Convert Stiffened Plates for Analysis :

o   This command converts plates along with stiffeners. Points corresponding
    to the resulting beam nodes  are embedded on the FEM plate. This would
    ensure that nodes will be created on plate at the embedded points.
    Beam nodes and plate nodes need to be merged using "Merge Nodes" command
    in I/FEM.

Define Conversion Options :

o   This command is used for setting global conversion options which will
    be used during the operations of other commands.

Convert All Elements :

o   This command is used for all STRUCT elements in a file.

Extend Elements to Surface :

o   This command is used to extend surfaces/curves to a surface. This
    command is meant to used for extending elements resulting from
    conversion of plates/beams/stiffened plates.  User should make sure
    that result of extensions is proper.
    
Trim Elements to Surface :

o   This command is used to trim surfaces/curves to a surface. This
    command is meant to used for trimming elements resulting from
    conversion of plates/beams/stiffened plates.  User should make sure
    that result of this command is proper.

Database Tables
===============

Two database tables have been created in $VDS/data/struct viz., isomat.f  and
prism_beam.f .

isomat.f

    This table contains material properties such as Elastic modulus, Poisson's
    ratio. There should be one entry for each material type and grade.
    The unit in the table should be either 'E' or 'M'. When the unit is 'E'
    it is assumed that all the values are in lb, in, Fahrenheit.  When it is
    'M', it is assumed the values are in Kg, cm, Centigrade. Presently only
    English units are implemented in the software. It will be extended to
    cover Metric units also in future.


prism_beam.f

    This table contains properties of prismatic beams. There should be one
    entry for each beam type and section.  The units are implemented as is
    done in isomat table.

User need to load the tables with the corresponding values of material and
beam section.


The catalogs can be created and loaded with parts using 'VDSloaddata'.

There are sample values in .p files.  User should load the tables with his
values.  Catalog isomat contains material properties for each material type
and grade used in I/STRUCT.  Catalog prism_beam contains  beam sectional
properties for each beam type and section used in I/STRUCT.

Installation Help
-----------------

	This product is optionally installed when I/STRUCT product is installed 
onto the system.
