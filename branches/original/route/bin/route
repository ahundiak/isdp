#   NAME
#
#   route - invoke Vds via drive
#
#   SYNOPSIS
#
#   route [Route arguments]
#
#   DESCRIPTION
#
#   This script allows one to invoke Route with drive in order to
#   ease the memory requirements of forking up subprocesses.
#
#   NOTE
#
#   This script works only with shells compatible with ksh.
#
#   However, this script could be easily modified to run under sh
#   -- although the result would be somewhat more verbose.
