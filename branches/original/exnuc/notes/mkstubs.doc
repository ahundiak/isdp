NAME

     mkstubs - reactive stub generator for EXNUC-based applications



SYNOPSIS

     mkstubs [-o file] -p prodname[:subdir] file ...



DESCRIPTION

     Mkstubs creates an assembler source file containing the stub functions
     corresponding to the reactive component of an EXNUC-based application.
     When this file is assembled and placed in the application kernel in lieu
     of the file(s) it was generated from, the application in the process of
     normal execution will automatically load these files as required.  The
     arguments to mkstubs are described below:

     -o file			Name of the file to write ouput to.  If not
				specified, output will be written to "stubs.s".

     -p prodname:subdir		Specifies the name of the product to generate
				stubs for.  This is the name as specified in
				the "/usr/ip32/product_data" file.  This
				information is used to determine the directory
				path ".../config/dload/prod/<subdir>" for
				reactive loading.  The subdirectory is optional
				and if omitted defaults to ".".  Multiple -p
				options may be specified on a single command
				line in which case it applies to all files
				listed before the next -p option.

     file			The name of a relocatable object file from
				which to generate stubs allowing said file to
				be reactively loaded.  If the named file is a
				directory, then all files ending with ".o" in
				that directory will have stubs generated for
				them.
