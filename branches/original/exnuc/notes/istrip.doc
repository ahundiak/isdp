NAME

     istrip - intelligent symbol table stripper


SYNOPSIS

     istrip [-a] [-c] [-l] [-x] [-s sect] [-n name] [-k name] [-p proto] files


DESCRIPTION

     Istrip removes all non-external symbols from the symbol table of an
     executable image.  The symbols removed can be controlled with one or
     more of the following options:

     -a			Strip all symbols (including externals) that would
			not otherwise be kept.

     -c			Ignore the leading underscore (_) when comparing
			symbols to the names given with -n and -k.

     -l			Strip any symbol corresponding to a shared library.

     -x			Do not strip static symbols.

     -s sect		Strip any symbol that is contained in the named
			section.

     -n name		Strip any symbol whose name matches the name given.
			If the specified name begins with '%', the remainder
			is interpreted as a regular expression.  Regular
			expressions are in the style of ed(1).

     -k name		Like -n except that matching symbols are NOT removed.
			This option does not apply to static symbols unless
			-x is also specified.

     -p proto		Specifies a prototype file.  This file contains -n and
			-k options one per line.  If proto is a dash (-) then
			istrip reads prototype information from the standard
			input.  Any -n or -k options specified on the command
			line override those in the prototype file.


     Any of the above options may be specified a multiple number of times.
     Istrip prioritizes the instructions given as follows:

	1) Symbols specified by explicit name.  The command line overrides
           any prototype files.  Conflicts are resolved in favor of keep.

	2) Symbols specified by a regular expression.  Regular expressions
	   are checked in the order encountered on the command line or in
	   a prototype file.  All those listed on the command line will be
	   checked ahead of prototype files.  Prototype files are priortized
	   according the order of the -p options.  The instructions associated
	   with the first match found are the ones carried out.

	3) The -a, -l, -x, and -s options.  If -x is specified, '.file'
	   symbols may be retained regardless of any other instructions.


EXAMPLES

     istrip			Strips all symbols except those that are
				external.

     istrip -a			Strips the entire symbol table.

     istrip -a -k "%_FI.*"	Strips all symbols except for those externals
				whose names begin with "_FI".

     istrip -a -c -k "%FI.*"	Strips all symbols except for those externals
				whose names begin with either "FI" or "_FI".

     istrip -l -s .text		Strips all symbols except for those externals
				not in a shared library or .text section.
