Checked out from willow in the lab
No password prompted for when checked out.  Need password to checkin. Prompts for it.

Got ^M in the readme file, build files are fine.

Using net beans, can we do a checkin?


Checked in by Mike Riley (lvskiprof@cox.net) from Netbeans 6.8 on laptop

Wish I could make those silly carot M go away,  I guess the lesson is dont use windows.  Probably change the file property.
