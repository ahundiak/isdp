   ____________________________________________________________________________

o  RIS Orphan Processes

   Several RIS applications have encountered an 'orphan process' problem in
   previous versions of RIS.

   Symptoms:

   1.  RIS Client and/or RIS Data Server processes continue to exist on the
       RIS client machine when a user re-boots their RIS application machine
       while connected to the database through RIS.  This happens when a RIS
       application is connected to the RIS client through TCP/IP.  Because the
       RIS client process exists, all RIS server processes connected to the RIS
       client process exist.

   2.  RIS Data Server processes continue to exist on the RIS server machine
       when a user re-boots their RIS client machine while connected to the
       database through RIS.  This happens when the RIS client machine is
       connected to a RIS Data Server through TCP/IP.

   The RIS Client 'orphan process' problem is fixed in this version of the
   RIS Client delivered with RISDP. The RIS Data Server 'orphan process'
   problem has been fixed in version 5.3.1 and later RIS Data Server
   products.

TRs/CRs

Following are new fixes for the RISDP:

[TR #439601782]
    RIS removal fails if the TEMP directory doesn't exist on the 
    System Drive.

[TR #439600540]
    RISCPP does not handle a slash in a declare cursor statement properly.
    When pre-processing the following statement, invalid output was
    generated in the C file:
      exec sql declare cur1 cursor for 
        select col1 from tab1 where col1 = '\t';

[TR #439600464]
    When an application uses the RIS functions to remove the RIS Shared
    Component, the RIS files are left on the system (Note: The RIS
    parameters file and schema file will not be removed).

[TR #439600123]
    When the "TEMP" environment is not set, or is set incorrectly, RIS
    installation returns the error:
           Script must call OpenLogFile before calling WriteToLogFile

[TR #439600036]
    RegRemoveRIS function to remove an application from RIS's reference
    list in the RIS registry entry is not working properly. It appears
    that the app version passed in by the application (listEntry) is
    being treated as if it is the RIS version.

[TR #439504016]
    During the RIS remove procedure a log file (risrem.log) is generated
    in '\tmp', but RIS places all other log files in '\temp'.

[TR #439503211]
    During installation of RISDP on Windows 95, RIS installs the file
    MSVCRT20.DLL in the directory \win95\system32 instead of
    \win95\system.

[TR #439503172]
    If the destination directory exists during installation, setup
    assumes that the product is loaded and is registered. It attempts
    to open registry keys for the shared component. If the keys are not
    present, setup fails.

[TR #439503097]
    Using setup with the "/n" option installs RISDP except the icon for
    'Remove RISDP' has an incorrect command (...\bin\remove.exe). There-
    fore, an attempt to remove the product will fail (cannot find file).

[TR #439503095]
    When using 'riscpp' to preprocess a file and the user mistakenly types
    the wrong extension for the file, e.g. 'file1.rc' instead of 'file1.c',
    RIS reports the file could not be opened(as expected), but then the C
    file is deleted.

[TR #439503094]
    Installing RISDP using the batch setup options(setup /h) and
    specifying an installation type other than "Full" still results in
    the complete RISDP package being installed.

[TR #439502591]
    A samples file, 'setup.rc', attempts to create a table using a
    reserved word("time").

[TR #439502559]
    The RIS load/unload functions RISlod_fprint_risloddes and
    RISuld_fprint_risulddes give application errors when executed.
    Note: The RIS pre-processor, 'riscpp', now adds the "/MD" compiler
    option. This option will need to be added by any user using the
    C compiler directly instead of using 'riscpp'.

[TR #439502402]
    Cannot use RIS 'C' preprocessor or RIS utilties after installation
    until the system is rebooted (cannot find shared DLLs).

[TR #439502371]
    If you install RIS for the first time to a fresh machine and then
    try to use a utility, you will receive an error.  Note: For remote
    RIS connections to the system, the machine must still be rebooted.

[TR #439501425]
    When installing RISDP using the Custom Installation option and using
    a PATH longer than 22 characters, the PATH listed to be installed to
    may be truncated.

[TR #439501289]
    Product does not provide a Package Definition File (PDF) or automated
    installation script for SMS.


Following are new fixes for the RIS Shared Component(Client and Utilities):

[TR #439601662]
    Cannot checksum a schema file or create a schema using a remote schema
    file on NTS 4.0 or NTW 4.0.

[TR #439601444]
    An application built on NT seems to have a memory leak when calling on 
    execute immediate, or prepare. The clear statement does not clear it.

[TR #439601283]
    Using RIS Schema Manager, TCP should be the default network protocol
    instead of XNS in the Create Schema form.

[TR #439601280]
    Application using RIS 05.03 on a Windows 3.1/WIN32S system receives
    a network error when trying to connect to a remote client.

[TR #439601220]
    RISGUI does not display more than 6 digits of a double field.

[TR #439600371]
    Using risbatch to locate a remote client, if the protocol is entered
    in lower case, the operation will fail with the error "Invalid
    choice".

[TR #439600181]
    The RIS interface on NT restricts the user to one language setting -
    the one that the system is set to. This means that one can not access
    an English schema and a Danish schema in the same session.

[TR #439600179]
    RISMGR causes an application error on NT when the environment variable
    RIS_LANGUAGE is set to Danish, and the NT language is set to English.
    The error identifies an access violation.

[TR #439503959]
    The "response interval" clause for the "set network verification"
    command is not working for a RIS Oracle Data Server on NT.

[TR #439503953]
    The RIS License List Utility is not displaying correct information on
    the number of active RIS data servers.

[TR #439503632]
    The Secure Schema Access screen locks up if you select a secure
    schema from the RIS Schema Manager first.

[TR #439503443]
    If 2 or more statements separated by 2 semi-colons(stmt1;;stmt2) are
    executed in Interactive RIS(risgui), the first statement is executed,
    the remaining statements are ignored, but the message indicates
    successful completion.

[TR #439503226]
    The RIS Server License List Utility should have a Help button that
    references the Licensing Help Information.

[TR #439503225]
    The RIS Server License List Utility should have default buttons
    that are selected when the 'Enter' key is used.

[TR #439503166]
    When attempting to run RISGUI and RISMGR and the system has version
    2.00 of MSVCRT20.DLL, the RIS utilities return errors and will not
    run.

    Error: "procedure entry point _adj_fdivr_m64 could not be found in
            DLL MSVCRT20.DLL"

    RIS now loads the 2.10 version of MSVCRT20.DLL. However, it's possible
    another application installation may overwrite this DLL with an earlier
    version.

[TR #439503090]
    When a table is dropped via RISMGR and in the same session the
    "Include Table" form is invoked, the table just dropped will appear.

[TR #439503065]
    Default options for the Include and Exclude Forms in RIS Schema
    Manager should be consistent with all other forms.

[TR #439502896]
    RIS reports an incorrect error name for an error number when using
    an invalid schema and selecting the "Dictionary Access" form.

[TR #439502890]
    If an invalid schema ( e.g. one where the RIS data dictionary has
    been dropped but the schema file still contains information on it) is
    selected from RIS Schema Manager(RISMGR) and the "Dictionary Access"
    button is selected from "Schema Definition", RIS gets into a loop
    reporting the error RIS_E_SCHEMA_DOES_NOT_EXIST.

[TR #439502842]
    The unsupported database type "SQL/DS" database type should be
    removed from the "Set" option of 'risgui' and 'rismgr'.

[TR #439502841]
    The "Set" option of RISMGR and RISGUI refers to Microsoft SQL
    Server as "MS SQLSR", but most other references use "MSSQL".

[TR #439502538]
    If the input filename used when inserting BLOBs into a database does
    not have the correct permissions(read access), RIS will return an
    internal error. The error should be RIS_E_OPEN_BLOB_FILE_ERROR.

[TR #439502534]
    Resetting some parameters in the parms file will cause a RIS data
    dictionary table to return invalid results.

[TR #439502302]
    In the 'Create Schema' form of RISMGR, if the 'Echo' flags are
    turned on for the passwords and then the Reset button is selected,
    the flags are returned to 'No Echo' but the passwords will still
    be displayed when entered.

[TR #439501699]
    During the RIS upgrade process, if only the schema file name, instead
    of a path and name, is entered for the version 5 schema file,
    risupgrd will error out with a signal 11 interrupt.

[TR #439501677]
    When English is commented out of the langs file, RISMGR core dumps.

[TR #439501608]
    RISMGR->Include Table->DBMS User field should be scrollable.
    The "dbms User" pulldown list for the "Include Table" command in
    RISMGR can only show 5 DBMS users.

[TR #439500875]
    RISLOD failed to load a view under the following circumstance:
      create view v1(col1,col2) as select col1,col2 from t1
    Problem occured when there was no space between the view name (v1)
    and the left parenthesis following it.

[TR #439500235]
    RISCLNSR fails to clean up the RIS dictionary tables when the tables
    have a process id identical to the process id of the server process
    that the RISCLNSR program starts up.

[TR #439407619]
    WIN32S - When a non-English language is specified to be used by
    RISinitialize(), or no RISinitialize() statement is used so that the
    default OS language is used, English will continue to be the language
    used by the application.

[TR #439407587]
    When the RIS client has been located on an NT system, trying to
    use an invalid schema file may cause the client to abort.

[TR #439407333]
    When RIS_PARAMETERS is set to an old or non-existent path, the RISMGR
    will core dump when trying to run it in interactive mode.  The RIS
    Interactive tool gives an error message stating that the parameters
    file could not be found.  So the RISMGR should do the same.

[TR #439406935]
    The RIS client on NT may return an invalid error name associated with
    an error number.

[TR #439406616]
    If a RIS unload file contains a schema name containing uppercase
    characters, the rislod utility will fail when executed with options
    specified on the command line.

[TR #439304729]
    An application on NT can not close files if it opens them before
    starting the client and the client is still active. The client
    inherits all open files from the application and does not know how to
    close them. The current workaround is to start the client before
    opening any files that the application may desire to delete, rename,
    or close.
