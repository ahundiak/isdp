RIS 05.04 Win32s Setup

Relational Interface Systems
Version 0.5
1996.06.24


1. Introduction
This document will describe the steps necessary to install the RIS 05.04
Runtime product on a Win32s system.  While the programs and files that
are part of the 05.04 RIS Runtime product are binary compatible with
Windows NT, Windows 95, and Win32s, RIS does not provide a setup for the
Win32s platform.  RIS for Win32s requires Win32s version 1.2 or later.

2. Create Directories
Create a directory named "c:\win32app\ingr\share\ris05.04".
From the directory created above, create the following subdirectories:

   bin
   config
   config\english
   config\english\forms (required for Schema Manager or Interactive
                        Utility)
   config\english\forms\v5forms (required for Schema Manager or
                                Interactive Utility)
   config\english\help (required to use Help)
   config\english\messages
   lib

3. Mandatory Files
The following files are mandatory for running RIS.  They can be found
on the Windows NT or Windows 95 system that has any RIS product
installed on it under either "c:\win32app\ingr\share\RIS05.04" or
"c:\Program Files\Common Files\Intergraph\RIS05.04".  On Win32s, place
files under "c:\win32app\ingr\share\RIS05.04".

   config\langs
   config\english\messages\ris.msg
   config\english\messages\net.msg
   lib\i9ris6.dll
 
The following file is also mandatory for running RIS.  It can be found
on the Windows NT or Windows 95 system that has any RIS product
installed on it in "c:\win32app\ingr\share" or
"c:\Program Files\Common Files\Intergraph".  The location on Win32s is
"c:\win32app\ingr\share".

  i9risu.dll

The following file is also required and should be placed in the
"windows\system" directory:

  msvcrt20.dll (Win32s version)

This dll can be found in Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.10 or 2.11
product directory.

Applications built for Win32s using RIS must deliver version 2.10 or
2.11 of msvcrt20.dll (Win32s version) in order for RIS to work.

4. INGR INI File
The ingr.ini file should be in the windows directory.  Create it if
needed.  The following should be added to the file:

 [RIS\05.04]	
 Version=05.04.XX.YY
 PathName=c:\win32app\ingr\share\ris05.04

5. Optional Files
The following files are optional for running RIS.  These files can be
found in "c:\win32app\ingr\share\RIS05.04" or
"c:\Program Files\Common Files\Intergraph\RIS05.04" on any Windows NT or
Windows 95 system that has a RIS product installed.  The location on
Win32s is "c:\win32app\ingr\share\RIS05.04".  Note that without Schema
Manager (RISmgr.exe), the locate client and schema operations will not
function.
