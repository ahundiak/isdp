Internal Storage Areas on Non-CLIX nodes

I. Basic "foreign node" setup

    1. Clearinghouse entries
    2. Hosts file
    3. Adding Node
    4. Adding Storage Areas for PC

II. Internal Storage Area on Novell Server

    1. Node setup
    2. Storage Area

III. Steps for DM/Manager and Storage Areas defined in I/NFM

    1. Internal storage area exists adding DM/Manager
    2. DM/Manager exists adding internal storage area



I. I/NFM can transfer files to Non-Clix nodes if they have been set up
   correctly. This includes both working storage areas and internal storage 
   areas. It is not advisable to use a standard PC node for an internal 
   storage area as it has no security built in to protect the data.

   The following information is to provide the administrator with the 
   required steps to have a "foreign node" set up for a storage area. 
   The only caution is that I/NFM can not provide the security on foreign
   nodes as is provided by the CLIX node when being used for an internal 
   storage area. To use the PC for a storage area and check out or in to 
   it the, following is required. As the I/NFM administrator do the 
   following:

   1) Create an entry in the /usr/lib/nodes/local directory. This file 
      should be the PC's node name and have the following format:
 
      Example: 

      PC nodename:             fixer
      tcpip address of the PC: 129.135.172.###
      operating system:        Non-CLIX
      Filename:                /usr/lib/nodes/local/fixer
      
      contents of file /usr/lib/nodes/local/fixer:

      tcp_address : 129.135.172.###
      NETMAP_info : IBM PC

      Restrictions for NETMAP_info: 

      The following are reserved to be used by I/NFM and should not be 
      placed in the /usr/lib/nodes/local file as the operating system 
      for the PC: 

          WINDOS
          CLIX
          UNIX
          SUNOS


   2) There must be an entry in the /etc/hosts for the PC. Be sure to 
      place it above a Namex line if Namex is in used on the I/NFM server.

      Stop and start tcpip (SU priveleges are required):

        # /etc/init.d/tcpip stop
        # /etc/init.d/tcpip

   3) Use I/NFM and add the PC as an I/NFM node. If a message is generated 
      the above steps are not complete.

   4) Use I/NFM to add a storage area that is on the PC (or other foreign 
      node). Be sure to use "/" in the path, example: c:/work/. Also it 
      must be terminated by "/". A username and password combination is 
      required. This password is for file transfer and it is not 
      necessarily a login/password to the PC as many do not have 
      username/passwords. However, if the PC does have a login/password,
      it is recommended to use it as it will be easy to remember if a need 
      should arise to change the storage area.

II.  For use with DM/Manager and I/NFM:

     Network package must be winsock compliant.
     To use a DOS Novell server as internal storage area use the following 
     guide lines:

    1) Select a node on the Novell net that WILL NOT BE USING DM/Manager. 
       Use the FTPSRV program (OR whatever is used by the PC for TCPIP 
       transfer) as a gateway to the Novell server. This node will need to 
       be set up as the above steps indicate. Be sure to give an easily
       remembered name to this storage area. The storage area will now be 
       accessible by all the DM/Manager nodes when selecting 
       OPTIONS / DEFAULT / STORAGE AREA.

    2) The STORAGE AREA that is setup for the Novell storage area should 
       have the following:

        a) The NODE that will be running the FTPSRV (or equivalent program).
        b) The PATH should be the drive letter of the network drive, such 
           as N:, and use "/" and be terminated by a "/".

        EXAMPLE:
      
        C:\> N:
        N:\login>  novell\nfmuser  <server name and login name>
        N:\home\nfmuser>           <novell user login directory>

        ***I/NFM PATH should be "N:/home/nfmuser/"

III. The one requirement for a PC to be both an internal storage area and
     a defined (through I/NFM) working area and a DM/Manager node 
     is that there must be TWO unique node names in the I/NFM tables.

     1) If the internal storage area (or working area) is defined already, 
        when installing the DM/Manager product select a new unique name 
        for the PC. DM/Manager will take care of the rest. The path for
        the storage area (working area) will be defined by the current 
        working directory. The initial current working directory set by 
        the installation of DM/Manager is c:\dmmgr\bin.

     2) If DM/Manager has been set up and an internal storage area needs 
        to be defined, then steps outlined in I. above must be executed 
        (if not already done). That is, a Clearinghouse entry in the 
        /usr/lib/nodes/local directory must be created and the setting up 
        of the node and the storage area through I/NFM.
