                      CLEARING HOUSE ENTRY INFORMATION 
                      -------------------------------- 

FOR CLIX MACHINES:
-----------------

On Clipper clearing house information is maintained in files nfms_ and nfme_
files. These files can be located in /usr/lib/nodes/heard or owned directory.
nfms_ files contain server information, nfme_ files contain environment info.
For combined clients an nfmc_ file contains enviroment information, local
machine will be the server.

The syntax of a nfms_ file is :

       Owner    : 000134bb.08-00-36-67-1c-02
       tcp_address  : 129.135.172.135
       Nodename : yoda

      Owner is Ethernet address of the machine on which the server exists.
      tcp_address  is TCP address of the machine on which the server exists.
      Nodename is Node name of the machine on which the server exists.

The syntax of a nfme_ file is :

       Owner        : 000134bb.08-00-36-67-1c-02
       Address      : 000134bb.08-00-36-67-1c-02
       tcp_address  : 129.135.172.135
       Nodename     : yoda
       NETPROP16  : f-$3$ceO?>pO762DF:6(H4)}b
       NETPROP17  : .jPKAIWs0VVI7$$q.JfDSdX3E
       NETPROP18  : I0U.d%[qU(/ 4[y:2\3y"uIGy
       NETPROP20  : [o)IkT(LYonW$V<fanU7Y"+R2
       NETPROP21  : VRP^mL+%$ELhln4;R>567V,xf

      Owner, tcp_address, Nodename are same as described for nfms_ file.
      They represent environment machine in case of nfme_ file.  NETPROP16
      is Network protocol used for the environment.  NETPROP17 and NETPROP18
      are RIS schema name and password for the environment.  NETPROP20 and
      NETPROP21 are User name and password for the environment.

The syntax of a nfmc_ file is same as for nfme_.



FOR NON-CLIX MACHINES:
---------------------

On Intel/Solaris clearing house information is maintained in NFMenv.dat,
NFMser.dat and NFMowne.dat files. These files are located in ~nfmadmin/clh_info
directory. NFMser.dat file contains server information, NFMenv.dat file contains
environment info and NFMowne.dat file contains local environments. For combined
clients NFMowne.dat file contains enviroment information and local machine will
be the server.

The syntax of a NFMser.dat file is :
( server_name, host_node, application )

Example :
nfms_intel0^Acgtd10^ANFM^A

The syntax of a NFMenv.dat file is :
( environment_name, application, host_node, encrypted schema_name, encrypted schema_passwd, encrypted user_name, encrypted user_passwd )

Example :
nfme_intel0NFMcgtd10Br<_(-::c=~,Z)`DumX!MDtMoNNL2#b6lsf&ku}>P\N^eNk}mDM!_\ICPhr4L0eh[}@K]MS&^/1&zN/x<!HCsmzoY]L@!*+xR?g>

The syntax of a NFMowne.dat file is same as that of  NFMenv.dat.
( environment_name, application, host_node, encrypted schema_name, encrypted schema_passwd, encrypted user_name, encrypted user_passwd )

Example:
nfme_intel0NFMcgtd10Br<_(-::c=~,Z)`DumX!MDtMoNNL2#b6lsf&ku}>P\N^eNk}mDM!_\ICPhr4L0eh[}@K]MS&^/1&zN/x<!HCsmzoY]L@!*+xR?g>
