 Dissociate A Process From A Transition :

	The table "nfmprocesses" stores information about the different 
	processes that can be  invoked in a transition. To dissociate a
 	process  from  a  transition, the 'program - transition'  entry 
	from this table is to be deleted.

	Steps to be followed :
	
	1. Get the 'n_programname' and 'n_transitionname' for the perti-
	   cular WorkFlow using the command "Display Transition/Processes
	   for a workflow" in Nfmadmin.

	2. Get 'n_programno'  from the table "nfmprograms"  using 
	   n_programname.
	
	3. Get 'n_transitionno' from the table "nfmtransitions" using 
	   n_transitionname.
	
	4. Delete the row from table "nfmprocesses" using n_programno and
	   n_transitionno.
