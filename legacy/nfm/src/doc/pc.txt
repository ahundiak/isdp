I/NFM 3.0 on the PC

INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  The following directory structure must exist on the pc.

    NFMCLI/           <similar to the nfm administrator directory>
    NFMCLI/BIN        <directory where the nfm executable is loaded>
    NFMCLI/TEMP       <directory where all the debug files are sent>
    NFMCLI/CFG        <directory where all the default information is> 

Note:  The above main directory "NFMCLI" can be called whatever
       the user wishes.  The naming of this directory is done during
       the install script.  The subdirectories (bin, temp, and cfg)
       must be named exactly as the example.

2.  Installation

    a.  To install and execute the nfmpc.tak software, 'ftp' from
        your I/NFM server machine the nfmpc.tak software and 
        execute using the take command:

        ftp:> get /usr/ip32/nfm/bin/nfmpc.tak \nfmpc.tak
        ftp:> take \nfmpc.tak

        The above commands brings two executables (cnfm.exe and
        ninstall.exe) and one text file (README) to your pc.  Within
        the cnfm.exe file is the software to generate the nfmpc
        executable, the nfmpc.msg and nfmpc.idx are used by the
        install script to generate the messages and forms seen
        during the installation.The ninstall executable, runs the
        installation menus created using the nfmpc.msg and nfmpc.idx
        files.  

    b.  To run the install script, execute the ninstall executable on
        the pc.

        C:\> ninstall -p <absolute path> -h <pc nodename> 
                      [-d -o <debug_file>]

	options :

        -p   Enter drive and directory where NFMPC is to be installed

        -h   Select the name of this PC

	-d -o Optional - for debug purposes

Note:  When the installation is complete all your directories (bin,
       temp, and cfg) should exist.  The 'nfmpc.exe' executable
       should exist in the the bin directory.   The 'defaults' file
       should be in the cfg directroy.

3.  Your nfm working storage area for the pc will be generated using
    the path where you are when you executed the pc executable. 
    This storage area will be created with a type of "D". 

4.  There are three ways in which a user can manipulate file
    information to/from the pc.  A command file, a command line
    argument in addition to the command file, or  a defaults file. 
    A command file can be given that contains all the information
    for logging in, setting defaults, manipulating data and logging
    out.  A command line argument can be used for logging in,
    setting defaults and a command file for data manipulation should
    be used with the command line argument. A defaults file will be
    used if the other options are not specified.  The defaults file
    must be located in the CFG directory.  This file keeps track of
    the pcid name and the location of the hosts file that nfm will
    be looking at to connect to the server. 

5.  There will be log files created for any command file used.  The
    log files will exist where you executed the command file and
    will be named the command filename with a prefix of "out". 
    Example:  ckincmd.out

6.  A Command File is used to execute certain nfm commands.

    Example: ckincmd

    CONNECT   
    LOGIN
    SERVER:<server name>
    ENVIRONMENT:<environment name>
    USERNAME:<user name>
    PASSWORD:<password>
    CATALOG:<catalog name>
    ITEMNAME:<itemname>
    REVISION:<revision number>
    command

    The above is an example of a possible layout for a command file.
    The example given below is how a command file would look to
    checkin several files from the pc.  The connect, disconnect,
    login or logout option were not included because the pc
    executable will attempt them regardless as to whether you
    specify them or not. 

    SERVER:certify
    ENVIRONMENT:certify
    USERNAME:nfmadmin
    PASSWORD:nfmadmin
    CATALOG:pccatalog
    ITEMNAME:pctest1
    REVISION:1
    CHECKIN_ITEM	<command>
    ITEMNAME:pctest2
    REVISION:1
    CHECKIN_ITEM	<command>
    ITEMNAME:pctest3
    REVISION:1
    CHECKIN_ITEM	<command>

    More that one command can be executed within a single command
    file.  A listing of the valid command is located in the Command 
    Line Interface section of the I/NFM Function Design Document.

    To execute a command file use the "-f" option when running the 
    nfmpc executable.  The command file option must always be the 
    last item on the line.Example:nfmpc.exe -f ckin.cmd

7.  To use a Command Line Argument, specify all information about
    connection and setting defaults on a single line following by
    the command file.  A listing of the valid arguments in located
    in the Command Line Interface section in the I/NFM Functional
    Design Document.  The command file must always be the last item
    on the line.

    Example:       

        nfmpc.exe -s certify -e certify -u nfmadmin -p nfmadmin -c
        pccatalog -i pctest2 -r 1 -f ckin.cmd2 

Note:  The ckin.cmd2 command file only needs to contain the command 
       in it.

8.  The defaults file is used exactly like a command file if one
    is not specified.  Please remember that the defaults file must
    be located in the CFG directory and named "defaults".

9.  To create debug on the pc use the -d and -o options.  Exactly 
    like creating debug when entering the alphanumeric interface or 
    during an nfm initial.  The commands file must always be the
    last item on the line.  All debug files will be created in the
    TEMP directory.

    Examples:

        nfmpc.exe -d -o <output file> -f <command file>
