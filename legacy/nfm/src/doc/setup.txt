Setting Up the I/NFM System

Before you can begin to use I/NFM, you must perform several set
up procedures to ensure that I/NFM will run properly.

You will first need to designate a node(s) on the network to be
used for loading I/NFM and the I/NFM supporting software. Depending
on your current configuration and hardware availability, there
are several options for loading the software. Typically, there
are two nodes, the RIS client node and the RIS server node which
are fixed, and as many additional nodes (or machines) as necessary
for I/NFM client nodes.

The RIS client node acts as the server for I/NFM to communicate
with the database. Software loaded on the RIS client node is the
RIS client software and the I/NFM server software. Because this
set of software acts as the I/NFM server, it must always be located
on the same node. The machine designated as the RIS server is
used to load the RIS server software and the RDBMS that you want
to use on your system: INFORMIX (Standard Engine or On-line),
INGRES, ORACLE, or DB2. The RIS server and RDMBS software creates
the actual database that will be managed by I/NFM and must always
reside on the same node no matter how you choose to configure
the system.

Finally, all machines on the network that will be used to access
I/NFM will be I/NFM client nodes. The only software needed on
these nodes is the I/NFM client software, which is the I/NFM user
interfaces or combined client server interface and the NFMfileserver.
The NFMfileserver enables each I/NFM client to communicate with
the I/NFM server during a file transfer.  The user interfaces
or combined client server interface lets users on an I/NFM client
node access the I/NFM software from anywhere on the network.

Note:  If you plan to use a VAX with your I/NFM system, the
       following exceptions will apply:

1.  If your RDBMS is INFORMIX (either Standard Engine or On-line), 
    you cannot load and operate INFORMIX or the I/NFM server
    software on a VAX. INFORMIX does not support the VAX product.

2.  INGRES, ORACLE and the RIS server software can be loaded and 
    used on a VAX.

3.  The DB2 RIS server software must be loaded onto the appropriate
    supporting DB2 machine.

The examples provided below will help you to record information
about each node that you want to use for I/NFM and to determine
the software that will be installed on each node.

Note:  If you choose to combine the software on the RIS server and 
       RIS client nodes, record the information for that single node
       here, instead of filling out both Steps 1 and 2.

1.  The RIS Server Node

    Nodename    __________________
    Username    __________________
    Password    __________________
    Pathname    __________________
    Software    __________________

The software required on the RIS server node is the RIS server 
software and your RDBMS.  The RDBMS can be INFORMIX, INGRES, ORACLE
or DB2.

2.  The RIS Client Node

    Nodename    __________________
    Username    __________________
    Password    __________________
    Pathname    __________________
    Software    __________________

The software required for the RIS client node is the RIS client
software and the I/NFM server software.

Fill in the information in the blanks below for the I/NFM client
nodes.  You will probably designate more than one or two machines
as I/NFM client nodes.  If so, make a list of all machines that
will need access the I/NFM server, and record them below. All
I/NFM client   nodes are required to have the NFMfileserver and
any application software.

3.  The I/NFM Client Nodes

    Nodename    __________________
    Username    __________________
    Password    __________________
    Pathname    __________________

Loading Software

Once you have determined the machines on your network to be used
in the I/NFM system, the next step is to load all appropriate
software.  If you are using TCP/IP for your network protocol,
you must load TCP/IP before you load any other software.  Before 
loading I/NFM, the underlying RDBMS must be loaded as well as
the RIS client and server software. I/NFM can then be loaded at
any time.

The procedures for loading the I/NFM software are determined by
whether the server is a Clipper workstation or InterServe. I/NFM
can be loaded into any usr partition.  A symbolic link will be
made to the /usr/ip32/nfm directory path when you load the I/NFM
software.

For instructions on loading the RDBMS software, refer to the
procedures delivered with that particular RDBMS.

For instructions on loaded the RIS software, refer to Relational
Interface System (RIS) Operator Training Guide.

For instructions on loading software on the VAX, refer to the
Intergraph Software Delivery Guide. For further instructions on
loading software on a workstation or InterServe, refer to the
Workstation Software Delivery Guide.

Installing I/NFM on a PC

Before you can install I/NFM on a PC, you must first load the
software to a workstation.

1.  Use the ftp utility from the PC where you want to install
    I/NFM.

    a.  Once you have accessed ftp, key in the following:

        ftp:> get /usr/ip32/nfm/bin/nfmpc.tak \nfmpc.tak
        ftp:> take \nfmpc.tak

    b.  When you complete these steps, key in the following at the
        DOS prompt to install the software.

        C:\> ninstall

Note:  To access the I/NFM README file, select the word Help, or 
       press the letter H.

2.  To start the installation process, select the word Install, 
    or press the letter I. You can select the <F1> key for help.

    a.  Enter the drive and directory where NFMPC is to be
        installed. 

    If you want to install NFMPC in the displayed directory, press 
    the <Return> key. If you want to enter a different directory,
    key in that directory name. If you want to edit the directory
    shown, press the END key and move to that position by using the
    arrow keys. Any key you enter will be inserted at that position.
    If you want to replace characters, press the INS key. If you
    want to abort entering a directory, press the ESC key and return
    to the installation menu.

Note:  If you are installing NFMPC on a computer with more than
       one hard disk drive, prefix the directory with the drive
       letter, for example, C:\nfmpc.

    b.  Select the name of this PC.

        Select the line that contains the name of this PC.  When you
        have selected the line, select the Okay to accept or the
        Cancel to return to the installation menu.  You can also
        press the letters O (Okay) and C (Cancel) on the keyboard. 

    c.  When you have completed these steps, select Okay to return
        to the installation menu. At this point, the installation
        has been successfully completed, but you can select to
        display the product README file, edit the hosts file, or
        leave the installation process.  

        To leave the installation process, select the word Quit, or 
        press Q on the keyboard.

3.  To edit the hosts file, select that option and use the
    horizontal scroll bars to display text to the left and right.
    Select the vertical scroll bars to display text up and down. 

    If you need help using the editing commands, press the <F1> key.

4.  Do not change the path or file name of the hosts file.  When 
    you finish editing, select Okay.

5.  The following are configuration restrictions for running I/NFM 
    on a PC.

    a.  If you move the PC hosts file, you must edit the DEFAULTS
        file in the \cfg directory for the new location.

    b.  The FTP directory must be in the path.

    c.  If you have more than one hard disk, the TCP/IP paths in the
        autoexec.bat file and any programs and/or drivers in the
        config.sys file must be prefixed with the disk drive.

Initializing I/NFM

The initialization procedures for I/NFM are contingent upon the
type of RDBMS that you have chosen: INFORMIX (Standard Engine or
On-line), INGRES, ORACLE, or DB2.  This section explains the
step-by-step instructions for initializing I/NFM with Standard
Engine or On-line INFORMIX only. 

For instructions on initializing I/NFM on ORACLE, see the appendix 
Initializing I/NFM with ORACLE in the I/NFM Administrator's
Reference Manual.

For instructions on initializing I/NFM with INGRES, see the appendix
Initializing I/NFM with INGRES in the I/NFM Administrator's
Reference Manual.

For instructions on initializing I/NFM with DB2, see the appendix
Initializing I/NFM with DB2 in the I/NFM Administrator's
Reference Manual.

Note:  INFORMIX must be initialized on the RIS server before you 
       can initialize I/NFM. All INFORMIX directories,
       subdirectories and files must have an ownership and group of
       informix. 

Before you invoke the initialization process, you must create 
a new user account on the node(s) where you have installed I/NFM, 
RIS, and the INFORMIX software. You must also create the I/NFM
database.

Note:  This document assumes that you know how to create login
       accounts and add passwords. If you do not, refer to the
       appropriate UNIX System V documentation (if you are working
       on a Clipper workstation or InterServe). 

1.  Create a new system account on the RIS client node for your 
    nfm administrator.

    a.  Log on to the RIS client node (where the I/NFM server
        software is installed).

    b.  Create a new system account on the RIS client node for your 
        nfm administrator.  A password on this account is mandatory.

        Username -     username for I/NFM admin
        Password -     password for I/NFM admin

    c.  In the .profile file for this account, add the following
        information, where /usrx is the partition that applies for
        each entry: 
 
        INFORMIXDIR=/usrx/informix    

        SQLEXEC=/usrx/informix/lib/sqlexec
                        OR
        SQLEXEC=/usrx/informix/lib/sqlturbo (if using INFORMIX On-line) 

        export INFORMIXDIR SQLEXEC

        If your database resides in a directory other than
        /usr/nfmadmin, you must include the following line in
        your .profile, and export that entry.

        DBPATH=/usrx/<I/NFM database administrator name>
        export INFORMIXDIR SQLEXEC DBPATH

2.  Create the database for I/NFM.

    a.  Log onto the I/NFM server machine using the account where
        you want your database to reside.  For example, if you are
        logged in an the nfm administrator, you database will be
        created in the administrator's default directory.

    b.  Key in the following line exactly as shown below to create
        the database:

        infxcreate <database_name> -e S  (for Standard Engine Informix)
                        OR
        infxcreate <database_name> -e O  (for Online Engine Informix)

        Your database should be created in the directory of your
        current user login. 

Note:  If you create your database under a login other than the
       nfm administrator, you will need to access isql and grant dba
       to the nfm administrator account for that database.  This
       must be done before you can initialize I/NFM.

3.  Initialize I/NFM

    a.  You should be logged into the RIS client node (or where the
        I/NFM software resides) using the nfmadmin account name.

    b.  At the $ prompt, key in /usr/ip32/nfm/bin/Nfminit

A series of forms appear on the screen.  Where applicable, defaults 
are displayed in brackets.  Modify and/or accept question by
pressing the <PF1> key. If you want to terminate the process at any
time while you are answering the questions, press the <PF3> key. 

Note:  Before you begin to answer the following questions, you might
       want to review the information that appears below each
       question, to ensure that you have the appropriate information
       to respond to the initialization. 

    c.  The first set of questions adds the administrator server
        node to I/NFM.
