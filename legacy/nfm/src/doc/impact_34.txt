B.  Non Technical

    1.  Product Structure
        This version of I/NFM carries forward the restructuring of the 
        I/NFM product that was introduced with version 3.3.  The I/NFM 
        user interface software has been separated from the I/NFM 
        server software.  Both the user interface and server products 
        will need to be newproded separately to the appropriate user 
        nodes.

    2.  Product Numbers
        A new set of product numbers have been generated for this 
        version of I/NFM.  Please note the new product numbers given 
        in section 1. of the abstract above.  The new product numbers 
        should not impact the installation of I/NFM to existing I/NFM
        systems.

C.  User Interface

    There have been no significant changes or enhancements to the 
    I/NFM user interfaces for this version.  Any customized menus or 
    forms will not be impacted by this release.

D.  API

    There have been no significant changes or enhancements to the
    I/NFM API in the I/NFM development platform.  Any applications
    built directly on the I/NFM API should not be impacted by this 
    release.

E.  Schema

    The structure and usage of the I/NFM database schema has not been
    altered by this release.  Applications that operate on the I/NFM
    schema apart from using the I/NFM API or the DB Access-I/NFM API
    should not be impacted by this release.  However, the allowed 
    values of the <catalog> n_setindicator column have been extended
    for this release.  The possible values for this column have been 
    enhanced to include the values "F", "D", "G", and "A".  Please 
    refer to section 3.a. on DM/Manager sets for information on the 
    new set definitions.

F.  User Interface to Server Protocol

    The user interface for I/NFM 3.3 will be able to communicate with
    the server software delivered with this release.  Should the I/NFM
    server be delivered into an existing I/NFM (release 3.3) 
    environment, the existing I/NFM (release 3.3) user interface 
    software will be able to operate with the new I/NFM server.

G.  Applications

    1.  I/PDM
        Enhancing the I/NFM set definition is one of the most
        significant changes in this release.  However, the changes
        have been explicitly designed to avoid impact of I/PDM
        catalogs, parts, and assemblies.  The definition of I/PDM
        assemblies (sets) has not been altered by this release of
        I/NFM.

    2.  DRAMS/PC
        Users of the DRAMS product suite on PCs may encounter a 
	problem if using DM/Manager and DRAMS both on a single PC 
        node.  The definition of the PC operating system in the 
        "nfmnodes" table to facilitate file transfers with DRAMS 
        does not work for DM/Manager file transfers due to an enhanced
        network file handling scheme devised for DM/Manager.  To use a
        PC as both a DRAMS client and as a DM/Manager client, an
        administrator will need to alias the PC node name and enter
        this new node name into the appropriate /etc/hosts file(s).
        If adding DRAMS to an existing DM/Manager PC, a new node alias
        will need to be created also, but an entry will need to be
        added to the /usr/lib/nodes/local directory of the I/NFM
        server(s).

    3.  DM/Manager

	a.  Sets
            The DM/Manager product has significantly enhanced the set
            types supported with I/NFM.  For a complete understanding
            of these types, the DM/Manager documentation and README
            file should be consulted.  For applications and projects
            that have been coded to explicitly test or set the 
            "n_setindicator" column in the I/NFM <catalogs> table to
            a value of "Y", these algorithms should be modified to
            test for values that are "not 'N'" and are "not NULL".

            During installation of DM/Manager users will be prompted 
            as to whether or not the "set registery utility" should be 
            run.  For an affirmative answer, the utility will scan all
            appropriate I/NFM environments, registering all sets to
            either a "folder", a "drawing", a "document group" or an
            "assembly" depending upon which applies.

        b.  Nodes/Storage Areas
            Due to the differences in how DM/Manager and the I/NFM CLI
            perform file transfers to and from the PC, the node 
            definitions for the PC will be different.  For PCs that
            will serve as both DM/Manager machines and I/NFM PC
            clients, multiple node entries in the "nfmnodes" table 
            will be required for the PC being used.  Working areas 
            created/defined by DM/Manager may not be used by DRAMS or 
            the I/NFM CLI due to the differences in how the working 
            area pathname is defined syntactically.

        c.  Version Stamp
            During installation of the I/NFM server software, all
            I/NFM environments will be stamped with a version 
            number indicator.  DM/Manager will only operate with
            an environment that has been stamped during I/NFM 3.4
            installation.

    4.  DMANDS Redline Template

        a.  Installation
            This release of I/NFM will install a "redline catalog"
            template into all database environments during software
            installation.  This should not cause any impact to
            users.  Applications that install templates need to make
            sure that their template installation cannot be disrupted
            by the inclusion of the redline catalog template.

        b.  Create Catalog
            During the create catalog command in the alphanumeric
            and I/Forms interfaces of I/NFM, users may elect to create
            a redline catalog by selecting the redline template which
            will be listed as an option on the "Basic Application"
            attribute.  Creation of redline catalogs must follow all 
            rules and conventions as set forth by the DMANDS/Redline 
            and DM/Redline products.  The user must be sure to append
            "_rl" to the end of the redline catalog names being
            specified.  These catalogs will not be displayed in the
            "Display List of Catalogs" listing.
