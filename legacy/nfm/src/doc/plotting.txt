Plotting

   o   I/NFM will now handle plotting for MicroStation files (no other
       type of file can be plotted).
 
   o   The following products must be present to be able to execute the
       "Plot" commands:
 
       NQS         SS01126 Network Queuing System
       IP_CNUC     SP01154 IP/CNUC (Client Nucleus)
       IP_IPLOT    SP01113 IP/IPLOT (IGDS/InterPlot Interface)
 
   o   Run 'pconfig' to make sure the plotting queues are configured
       correctly. You may have to run /usrx/ip32/ip/cnuc/bin/fetch for the
       pipe queue you are going to use to make it known to the IP software.

   o   An item must be added for each design file to be plotted. The "Local
       File Name" will be the design file name. If it is a Microstation file,
       the "File Type" needs to be "M".
 
   o   In order to plot files, an IPARM file needs to be associated and 
       checked-in for the item/set. IPARM files are generated using IP_IPLOT.
       This product will put the absolute path of the design file in the 
       IPARM file.  Since I/NFM is using the "nfm" storage area to plot 
       files, it is very important that the IPARM file be created with a 
       design file located the "nfm" storage area directory.

       Note: This will be necessary until IP_IPLOT provides the ability 
             to search for design files in alternative directories.

       Example:

       Say that the pathname for the "nfm" storage area is 
       "/usrx/nfmadmin". Your design file must reside is this
       directory to generate the IPARM file. The following command 
       will generate an IPARM file usable by I/NFM and IP_IPLOT together:

       $ iplot create -design=<file>.dgn -queue=<queue> <file>.i

       You can also create your IPARM file specifying the entire path
       of your design file:

       $ iplot create -design=/usrx/nfmadmin/<file>.dgn -queue=<queue> <file>.i

       Since all plots are submitted from the "nfm" storage area, this will 
       ensure that the plotting software will find everything needed to
       plot the item/set.

   o   To add the IPARM file to your item/set, you must execute the "Add
       File to Item" command. The "Local File Name" should be the IPARM file
       name. The "File Type" must be "P" to let I/NFM know that this is an 
       IPARM file.

   o   You must check in the design and IPARM files.

   o   If the active item to be plotted is a set, the set will be plotted.

   Troubleshooting:

   o   Make sure that your item/set has an IPARM file associated with it.

   o   Make sure that you can plot your design files from the command
       line. This way you'll know if there is a problem plotting that the
       queue and the printer are okay.
 
   o   To plot from the command line, you need the design file ('.dgn'),
       the IPARM file ('.i'), and a metafile ('.m') file. You have the
       design file and IPARM file. You must generate the metafile.
 
           $ iplot generate <file>.i
 
        - Submit the plot to the appropriate queue:
 
           $ iplot submit <file>
