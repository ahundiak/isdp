:Define Origin:
This command allows you to specify the origin point of a view
in the active part.  A part with a defined origin is the same as
a named view.

origin is PDUview<T>, but the viewname can be changed.

:Define Search Criteria:
This command lets you describe how the system will search
for parts in a catalog.  For example, you can set up a criteria
to search the system and produce a listing of parts in a
catalog that were created by a certain person at a certain
time.  The creator of the part and creation time/date are the
attributes that describe the part. Search conditions in this
case, consisted of choosing values for these attributes and
searching the system for all parts whose attributes match
these values.

Each search condition can be built in two ways:

1.   By choosing values for part attributes.

2.   By constructing a logical statement of attribute values
     and attribute operators.

Using logical operators along with attribute values will let
you search for more than one attribute value at a time, or
search with a range of values.  For example, the system can
search for parts that have a part number between 10 and 100.
You can also search for the highest revision # for a part.

A list of possible attributes will appear in the Attributes<T>
palette of the Part Selection<T> form.  You can display a list of
the possible values for that attribute by tapping the middle
mouse button on the desired attribute in the Attribute<T> column.
You can place a data point in the Operators<T> column to display
a list of possible operators.  Tap the middle mouse button on
the operator to select the desired operator.

<S>Possible Operators<T>

The following are valid RIS operators:
<F>

(=)       equals
(>)       greater than
(<)       less than
(>=)      greater than or equal to
(<=)      less than or equal to
closest>   closest to but not greater
           than
closest<   closest to but not less than
between   between

searches.
<F>
