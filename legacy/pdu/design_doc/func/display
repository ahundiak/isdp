2. ABSTRACT

.LP
This functionality provides control over displaying nested parts in assemblies.
It also provides selective read in of data and file transfer based on what
is displayed.

.SH
3. KEYWORDS

.LP
LOGIN, COPY TO LOCAL, DELETE LOCAL FILE, CHECKOUT, CHECKIN, RETRIEVE.

.SH
4. FUNCTION PROTOCOL

.LP
Does not apply.

5. DEPENDENCIES

.LP
.IP "Assumptions:"
This functionality assumes that the user must be in EMS. This
functionality could be invoked within the context of any "EMS" retrieval
of an object space. This functionality may also be invoked from the PDM design
operations form. This functionality will only be available if PDU product
is loaded. This functionality requires a PDM login when retrieving parts
from PDM.

.IP "Impacts:"
This functionality will impact the EMS retrieve command in that only the
reference attachments marked for display will be read. It will also impact 
the object space directory subsystem in that all the assembly display
information will be stored in that assembly's directory structure. This
functionality impacts file transfer and the local file manager in that only 
the files that would be necessary for assembly display will be brought locally.
Typically, PDM checkin, checkout, and cancel checkout will be dependent
on this functionality. This functionality will replace attach and detach 
part commands.

6. ALGORITHMS

.LP
This functionality involves displaying the assembly display structure in 
a form. This form has the following information included:

   a)   level number
   b)   catalog name
   c)   part number (occurrence name, see edit occurance)
   d)   revision
   e)   description
   f)   display status field (no/yes)

If this functionality is invoked, the following logic is executed:

 o If this functionality is called from database retrieve(retrieve option form)

   1. Call PDM login, if not logged in. 
      
   2. Select part, Get part status.

      2.1. If part is checked in, checkout the parent file.

      2.2. If part already checked out, prompt user if want to alter display.

           2.2.1. If want alter, display assembly display structure.
           
                  2.2.1.1. Based on display setting, copy/delete
                           children files. (no -> delete, yes -> copy).

                  2.2.1.2. Update assembly display structure.

           2.2.2. If not, check if "alter display toggle" is set to "yes".

                  2.2.2.1. If yes, display assembly display structure.

                           2.2.2.1.1. Based on display setting, copy/delete
                                      children files. (no -> delete,
                                      yes -> copy).

                           2.2.2.1.2. Update assembly display structure.

                  2.2.2.2. If no,  copy/delete part files based on resolved 
                           assembly display structure.

           2.2.3. Call EMS retrieve. (stop).


 o If this functionality is called from EMS retrieve (retrieve option form)

   1. Select file, if "alter display toggle" is set to "yes".

      1.1. Call PDM login, if not logged in. 

      1.2. Display assembly display structure.

           1.2.1. Based on display setting, copy/delete children files.
                                            (no -> delete, yes -> copy).
       
           1.2.2. Update assembly display structure.

      1.3. Call EMS retrieve. (stop).

   2. If "alter display toggle" is set to "no", call EMS retrieve. (stop).


 o If this functionality is called from design (PDM design form)

   1. Display assembly display structure.

      1.1. Based on display setting, copy/delete children files.
                                     (no -> delete, yes -> copy).

      1.2. Update assembly display structure. (stop).
