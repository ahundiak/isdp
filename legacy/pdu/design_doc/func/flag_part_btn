  Date:      9/1/93
  Revision:  1


  Abstract:  

  This document describes the necessary changes to add the flag part
  command to the PDM Utilities form.

  The user will select a part(s) either in the Part Selection area or the
  Parts/Files Listing area on the PDM Utilities form.  When the user selects
  the flag part command, a form will be displayed for the user to select
  flag or unflag and the type of flagging operation to be performed.


  Keywords:

  Flag Part


  Return Status:

	PDM_S_SUCCESS
        PDM_I_PART_IN_ASS
        PDM_E_PART_OCCURS_IN_ASSEMBLY


  Assumptions:

  The user must select a part before invoking the command.

 
  Impacts:

  The user will still be able to flag a part through Change Mode on the
  Part Operations form.

  The user will be able to select a single part or multiple parts for
  flagging through the PDM Utilites form.

  The user will not have to wait for attribute retrieval before flagging each
  part through the PDM Utilities form.

  None
