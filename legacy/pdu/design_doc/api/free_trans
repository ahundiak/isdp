  Title:     API Design Document pdmoFreeTransStructure
  Date:      8/18/93
  Revision:  5

  Abstract:  

  This API frees the transisition structure that contains a list of possible 
  transitions for a part.

  Keywords:

  Free Transition Structure

  pdmoFreeTransStructure(spm_trans)

  Input:

	struct   part_transition      *spm_trans

  Output:

	None

  Sample Invocation:
 
    status = pdmoFreeTransStructure(&trans_list);

  Input Limitations:

	spm_trans:     	required
                        a linked list of structures
                        pdmoGetTransitions must be called before calling
                          pdmoFreeTransStructure

  Structure:

  struct part_transition
  {
  char                 cpr_statename[IK_STATENAME_MAX];
  char                 cpr_transition[IK_TRANSNAME_MAX];
  int                  ir_stateno;
  struct part_transition *spm_next;
  };

  Return Status:

	PDM_S_SUCCESS
	PDM_E_NULL_LIST
	PDM_E_USER_NOT_LOGGED_IN

  External Functions:
 
  None
 
  Assumptions:

  The pdmoGetTransitions API must be called to allocate the part_transition
  structure before pdmoFreeTransStructure is called.
 
  Impacts:

  None
 
  Future:

  None

  Test Cases:
 
    Success
 
  Pass in a list that has been allocated in pdmoGetTransitions.
 
    Failure
 
  Pass in a null list.

  Algorithm:

- if trans is NULL
	- return error message
- free each entry in the link list
- set the pointer to the link list to NULL
- set the status
- return
