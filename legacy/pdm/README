  { SUN }

  The PDU software package requires kernel modification in order to run on
  the SUN OS.  The kernel can be reconfigured by the following steps.

      Create a kernel configuration file as root:
        $ su
        # cd /usr/sys/sun[3,3x,4,4c]/conf
        # cp GENERIC NEW_KERNEL  (where NEW_KERNEL represents the name
                                     of your new configuration)
        # chmod +w NEW_KERNEL

      Modify the new configuration file:

        # vi/emacs NEW_KERNEL
                - search for the line that beings with "ident" and
                  change the kernel name from GENERIC to NEW_KERNEL

                - search for IPCMESSAGE and make sure that the following
                  lines are not commented out:

                  options IPCMESSAGE      # System V IPC message facility
                  options IPCSEMAPHORE    # System V IPC semaphore facility
                  options IPCSHMEM        # System V IPC shared-memory facility

                - search for TLI and make sure that the following lines are
                  not commented out

                  pseudo-device   tim64
                  pseudo-device   tirw64
                  pseudo-device   tcptli32

                - exit and save the file

        # cp NEW_KERNEL /usr/kvm/sys/sun[3,3x,4,4c]/conf
        # config NEW_KERNEL
        # cd ../NEW_KERNEL
        # make

      Install the kernel:

        # mv /vmunix /vmunix.orig
        # cp vmunix /vmunix

      Halt and reboot the system:

        # /etc/halt
        > b

      Since the SUN does not broadcast to the network, the host files
      need to be edited.

      All nodes that have a PDM server that you will login into or check in
      files into must exist in the host file.

      - On the SUN
              - $ su
              - # vi/emacs /etc/hosts
              - add the nodenames and tcp addresses of all workstations
                that will be networking with the SUN

      - On the CLIPPER (servers) or ANY (storage areas)
              - $ su
              - # vi/emacs /etc/hosts
              - add the nodename and tcp address of the SUN

              You must create a node file in the /usr/lib/nodes/heard
              directory for the check in storage areas that will
              be checked in from a SUN workstation.  If the check in
              storage area happens to be a SUN workstation you need to
              create a /usr/lib/nodes/heard directory and place
              the client SUN node file information in this directory.
              Instructions on how to do this are below:

              - # cd /usr/lib/nodes/heard
              - # cp <nodename> <filename>
                      (where nodename = the nodename of the CLIPPER and
                      filename = the nodename of the SUN)
              - # vi/emacs <filename>

              - edit the ethernet address of the SUN on the lines that say
                "Owner" and "Address"

              (Note:  The ethernet address of the SUN is printed on the
                      screen when the workstation is booting.)

              - edit the tcp address on the line that says tcp_address
              - save the file


      NOTE:   SUN Users
              The NFMdaemon will be automatically started when NFM is
              loaded and each time that the workstation is rebooted.

              If Check In fails, check to make sure the NFMdaemon is
              running.

              - $ su
              - ps -aux

              If the NFMdaemon is not running, either reboot the
              workstation or kick of the NFMdaemon as follows:

              - $ su
              - # /home/ip32/nfm/bin/NFMdaemon &

  { End of SUN }

  { Converters }	
    
    The existing 1.3 and 1.4 EMS files must be converted with the EMS
    2.0 converter.  The files will also need to be converted for PDU. 
    This conversion will available on a subsequent fixes release.  

  { End of Converters }

------------------------
End of Installation Help
------------------------

Getting Started
---------------

    You must execute the I/EMS product to get into PDU/PDM.  If you log into 
    the CLIX system you can execute I/EMS with the command
      $ /../../ems/bin/ems
    where /../.. represents the location of the product.

    The user may also setup an alias for the CLIX path name to execute I/EMS.
    This is done by appending the .env file in the login directory.
      $ cat >> .env <CR>
        alias -x ems='/../../ems/bin/ems' <CR>
        <CTRL D>

    After you are in the EMS environment, you select the PDU icon on the
    EMS menu strip to activate the PDU environment.

  { README }

    To provide a quick method for finding information in this file, headings
    have been included in braces {}.  The CLIX pg command can be used to go
    directly to the section listed within braces.  Example:
      $ pg +/'{ FEATURES }'/ README
    When actually in the pg command, single quotes (') are not necessary.
    Example:
      :+/{ Initialization }/

Version Converter
-----------------

  VERSION CONVERTER FOR THE 2.0 DATA STRUCTURE WILL BE DELIVERED IN A LATER
  RELEASE.

  Design files which have been saved with I/PDU version 1.3.X or version
  1.4.X must be converted to 2.0.X data structure.

  Details of how to convert the files will be documented in the README
  file in the release that delivers the convertor.

------------------------
End of Version Converter

----------------
Change Part
----------------

  { Changing Storage Area }

    To change the storage area of an existing part you must first select
    the new storage area and then edit the file type column and select
    the change part command.  This is a temporary workaround.

  { End Changing Storage Area }

-----------------------
End of Change Part
-----------------------

---------------------------
Part Number/Revision Length
---------------------------

  { Place Part }

    If you specify a part number and revision length in the catalog to exceed
    a total of 72 characters.  When placing the parts from the catalog in
    other sub-assemblies you must specify a usage-id instead of using the
    default usage-id.  The usage-id that you enter must be less than 90 
    characters.  This is a workaround.

  { End of Place Part }

----------------------------------
End of Part Number/Revision Length
----------------------------------

------------------
Save/Restore Forms
------------------

  { Form lock up }

    There is a random problem with some save/restore forms locking up in
    PDU.  To workaround the problem, you should convert the save/restore
    form to a permenant window and proceed with manipulating the form. 
    The convert to permenant window icon is in the upper right corner of
    the form.

  { End of Form lock up}

-------------------------
End of Save/Restore Forms
-------------------------

--------------
NFS Attachment
--------------

  { Using NFS to Attach Part }

    FOR PARTS THAT WE BE ATTACHED USING NFS YOU SHOULD SPECIFY A STORAGE
    FILENAME WHEN ADDED THE PART.  IF YOU LEAVE THE STORAGE FILENAME
    BLANK NFM WILL COMPUTE A DIFFERENT STORAGE FILENAME FOR EACH NEW
    VERSION CHECKED IN WHICH WILL DISTURB THE NFS MOUNTED FILES.

  { End of using NFS to Attach Part }

---------------------
End of NFS Attachment
---------------------

-----------------------------------
Network Communication/File Transfer
-----------------------------------

  { Login and File Transfers }

    You must download the I/NFM product minimal of File Server and
    utilities.  Refer to the Installation Help section of this README
    file.  The network connection that communicates to the PDMserver
    will be spawned from the NFMdaemon process.  This process will be
    spawned at boot time.  All file transfer will be driven by the 
    NFMfileserver.  If you are having problems logging in or
    transferring files check the following:

	- Is the NFMdaemon process running?  If not, reboot the workstation.
	- Check the /etc/nfmd.conf file for the proper location of where
   	  NFM is loaded.  If /etc/nfmd.conf file doesn't exist or
	  location of NFM is incorrect.  Redownload NFM.

  { End of Login and File Transfers }

New Features
------------

 { User-Interface }

   The user interface for I/PDU has be enhanced significantly.  All the 
   commands are invoked from the forms.  Selecting the I/PDU icon on the 
   menu strip will launch you into I/PDU.  After logging into the database 
   you will see the main form of PDU.  From this main form you can do the 
   following:

	o List Parts/Files 
		You may list out parts in a particular catalog, search
		for a part in one or more catalogs, list out the files in 
		your local working area, or list out the files that you have
                checked in previously.

	o File Manipulations
		You may select one or more parts from the listing area 
		or specify a part in the part selection area and manipulate
		it's file(s).  You may choose to work on the assembly design 
		of the part you may select the design command which will 
		create a new file for the part or open up the existing file 
		for the part.  You may check in, check out, copy the file
		to the local working area, or delete the file from your
		local working area.
		
	o Catalog
                This will display the forms from which you can execute
		the catalog related commands such as Create, Change, Copy
                and Change, and Delete.

	o Parts
		This will display the form from which you can execute the
		part related commands such as Add, Change, Delete, etc.

	o Reports
                This will display the form from which you can execute
		the report related commands.  You may define, display, 
		or delete a report.  You may print the report that you
		are displaying.

	o Assembly Structure
		This will display the form of the assembly structure related
                commands that you may execute.  You may define the structure 
		of an sub-assembly that is non-graphic.  You may manipulate 
		the structure of an existing assembly non-graphically.

	o Design
		This will open up the file for the part and display a
		form which contains all of the assembly design commands
		such as (Place Part, Define Origin, Replace Part, Edit
		Part, etc.)

  { End of User-Interface }

  { Use of GRpart }

    When placing a part/sub-assembly in an assembly we create an I/EMS GRpart.
    This allows the EMS part commands to recognize PDU parts and include them 
    into their parts list.  

  { End of Use of GRpart }

  { Multiple Files per Part }

    You may add additional files to a part through the Change Part/Add Files 
    command.  All files will be transported together during check in, 
    check out or copy file(s) to local.  This can be used to tracking document
    files, mass property files or cell libraries.

  { End of Multiple Files per Part } 

  { Reports }

    There are several different types of reports that PDU/PDM can
    generate (Bill of Material, Parts List, Summary BOM, Where Used,
    Part Listings and Catalog listings).  The reports definitions are
    stored in the database and in the future can be saved to template 
    libraries for further enhancements through DBACCESS Report Writer.  The
    reports are generated by DBACCESS and displayed to the user.  They can
    be printed to an ascii file.
    
  { End of Reports }

  { NFS Attachment }
    
    You may attach the part's file using NFS.  You must setup the
    database and workstation as follows for use of NFS:

	1. Load NFS product on workstation that PDU resides and workstation
	   that is the storage location for the part.
	2. Go into the NFM interface and change the node of the PDU
   	   workstation and node of the storage location to NFS is "Y".
	3. Go into the NFM interface and change the local working area
  	   and set the NFS to "Y".
	4. Go into the NFM interface and change the storage area that is
	   the part's storage location and set the NFS to "Y".
	5. On the PDU workstation, edit the /etc/exports file and add a
  	   line for the partition name that the file is checked into.
	6. Run /etc/exportfs
	7. Verify the mount by typing in /etc/showmount -e <nodename>.

    REMINDER: The part's storage filename should be defined and not let
		blank.  See the Product section of this README file for 
		details.

  { End of NFS Attachment }
 
  { Attribute Subsystem }

    When you create or change a catalog, you can define the following 
    characteristics for each attribute:

	o Protections 
	    Read - Specifies whether the user can view the part's attribute 
			values in the listings.
	    Write - Specifies whether the user can view the part's attribute 
			at the Add Part time.
	    Update - Specifies whether the user can change the part's 
			attribute value at the Change Part time.
	    Delete - Specifies whether the user can delete the attribute 
			at the change catalog time.

	o Required Data
	    User Input Required - Specifies whether the user must key in
					a value for this attribute when adding
					a part.
					
	o Data Validation
	    Range - For attributes that are NOT character datatype, you
			can give a validation range that will be verified 
			when the user keys in a value at Add Part/Change Part
			time.
	    List - You can give a list of values that the user can
			select from at Add Part/Change Part time.  If
			the user keys in a value, it will validate it
			agains the list.
			
  { End of Attribute Subsystem }
  
  { Assembly Structure }

    While working on the assembly design for a sub-assembly or assembly,
    the assembly structure will be generated automatically if you set the
    explode indicator for the part occurence to "Yes".  You may display the
    assembly structure of the active assembly at any time.  You may
    attach all the files in the sub-assembly from this assembly
    structure form.   You can also delete parts and detach parts by selecting
    the part from the structure form.  If the explode indicator is set
    to "No" you can attach the sub-assembly file only.

  { End of Assembly Structure }

 TR # 92W1323 

 ASSEMBLY STRUCTURE--DELETE
 After you select an assembly part in the structure to delete, a
 prompt is displayed to confirm the deletion.  Don't say y or n, press
 the execute button instead.  It acts like it deletes and the form
 clears.  The confirmation prompt remains.  Answer y and you get
 kicked out with a seg violation.


 TR # 92W1330 

 ADD PART
 I tried to add a part with no part type.  I received the error
 message.  I then entered a lower-case g as the part type.  The system
 crashed with a memory-fault--seg. violation.
