This is the actual source code used to deliver the isdp version
if XFORMS.  I just copied it off of whtpine.  To actually build,
need to make a user called forms and setup the profile/env files.  Copy them off
of user forms on whtpine as well.

Aslo, some of the files have had printf statements added to them.  The files with
.c1 extensions are the original code without the printf statements.

If anyone is actually going to start doing xforms builds, then we really need to
setup a pinnacle directory and get this stuff checked in.

When properly setup, the file source/sysinfo/build.sh rebuilds everything and makes
a newproddable directory.  It builds pretty fast so I never bothered to figure out how
to make an incremental build.  Just change your source code (xforms/source/xfi/src) ,
rebuild everything and newprod to test.

There is a load.it script to make newprodding quicker.
