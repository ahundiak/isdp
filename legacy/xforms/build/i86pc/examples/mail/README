mailer - This example is a mailer using the "elm" executable,
	 therefore you must have elm currently on your machine for
	 this executable to work.

	 Mailer will allow you to load in an "elm" mail file on the
	 command line. Ex. "mailer aliases.text".  The aliases.text
	 is an elm file located in your home directory under the
         directory named ".elm".  This file contains aliases you
	 may have defined while running elm.


NOTE:    When sending mail always specify your building as the
	 first stop in the path.

		Ex.
		
	 
	 You are located in building 23a and your want to send a
	 problem report for I/FORMS use the following Email path:

		b23a!b17c!chunn!iforms

	         ^
		 |  Your building first.
