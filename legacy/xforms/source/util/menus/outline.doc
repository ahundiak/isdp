+++.  Menu Outline

The menu outline is a text file describing a panel, bar or pocket menu in an
outline format.


+++.1  Panel Menu Outline

In a panel menu outline, the button/palette hierarchy is represented by the
tab indention.

o  0 tabs
	Indicates the menu declaration.
	
	The menu declaration defines the menu type as a panel, the format
	version, and general panel menu characteristics.

	The menu declaration may also include a menu description.

o  1 to 4 tabs
	Indicates a button declaration.

	Each line defines a button in the panel menu.

	The location of the button in the panel hierarchy is determined by
	comparing the number of tabs on the current line to the number of
	tabs on the previous line.  The results are interpreted as follows:

	>	The current line is the first button of a new palette.  This
		new palette is activated by the button defined on the previous
		line.

	<	The previous line defined the last button in the current
		palette.  The current line defines the next button in a higher
		level palette.

	=	The current line defines another button in the current palette.

o  more than 4 tabs
	Indicates an error.


The lines in a panel menu outline can be very long.  Lines can be continued
by preceding the newline character <CR> with the continuation character `\'.

Any line in a panel menu outline may be commented.  All characters after
the sharp sign, `#', are considered part of a comment and are not interpreted.

+++.1.2  Panel Menu Button Declaration

The rest of the outline describes the buttons and the button hierarchy.  The
graphics on a panel menu button can be either symbol graphics or text graphics.
The line defining a panel menu button with symbol graphics looks like:

	<name>, <symbol file>, <symbol #1>, <symbol #2> [, button options]

The line defining a panel menu button with text graphics looks like:

	<name>, "<text string>", <font name>, <text size> [, button options]


+++.1.2.1  Panel Menu Button "Name"

The <name> field is required both for buttons with symbol graphics and for
buttons with text graphics.  The relationship of this button to the next button
and the syntax of <name> are used to interpret <name>.


o  When the button activates a palette defined within the outline, i.e. the
   next line is indented an additional tab, <name> is the name of the palette.

   <name> is also used to generate the file name of the palette.  The file name
   is the first 14 characters from:

			    <prefix><name>

   where:
	<prefix> is the optional palette prefix argument to genmenu.

   In the file name, characters other than letters, numbers, the period, `.',
   and the underbar, `_', are replaced by underbars.


o  When the button is a bottom level button that activates a command, <name>
   specifies the command to activate.  The syntax of <name> determines its
   interpretation.

   If <name> is quoted, i.e. "place line segment", it is interpreted as a
   command string.

   If <name> is not quoted, i.e. GRMPlcLnSeg, it is interpreted as a command
   key.


o  When the button activates a palette not defined in the outline, <name>
   specifies the file name of the palette to activate.  The syntax is:

			*<palette file name>

   The length of the palette file name may not exceed 14 characters.


+++.1.2.2  Panel Menu Symbol Button

In addition to the button "name" field, the required fields for a panel menu
button with symbol graphics are:

o  <symbol file>
	Specifies the symbol file containing symbols #1 and #2.  The length of
	the filename may not exceed 14 characters.

	If a symbol file is not specified, the symbol file specified in the
	general panel menu options is used.  At least one of the two must be
	defined.

o  <symbol #1>
	Specifies the symbol that is displayed on a symbol button.  Valid
	symbol numbers are 0 to 255 inclusive.
	
o  <symbol #2>
	Specifies the second symbol that is displayed on a symbol button.
	Valid symbol numbers are 1 to 255 inclusive.  Use -1 if a second symbol
	will not be displayed.


+++.1.2.3  Panel Menu Text Button

In addition to the button "name" field, the required fields for a panel menu
button with text graphics are:

o  "<text string>"
	Specifies the text string that is displayed on a text button.  The
	quotes define the button as a text button.

	To specify multiple lines of text, embed the `\n' characters between
	the lines in the text string, e.g. "First Line\nSecond Line".

o  <font name>
	Specifies the font for the text displayed on a text button.  The length
	of the font name may not exceed 14 characters.

	If a font name is not specified, the font name specified in the general
	panel menu options is used.  At least one of the two must be defined.

o  <text size>
	Specifies the M-squared size of the text displayed on a text button.
	The size must be greater than zero.

	If <command> is not quoted, i.e. GRMPlcLnSeg, it is interpreted as a
	command key.


When a button activates a palette defined within the outline, the palette
characteristics can be modified with the following options:

o  NUM = <n>
	For the palette activated by this button, defines the number of buttons
	in a row.
	By default, NUM is the number defined in the general panel menu options
	for the palette's level.

o  WD = <n>
	For the palette activated by this button, defines the width (in pixels)
	of the buttons.
	By default, WD is the width defined in the general panel menu options

	When both NUM and WD are specified, NUM controls.

o  HT = <n>
	For the palette activated by this button, defines the height (in pixels)
	of the buttons.
	By default, HT is the height defined in the general panel menu options
	for the palette's level.

o  REM = yes/no
	For the palette activated by this button, defines whether the palette
	"remembers" the last button that was depressed.  If so, when the
	palette is redisplayed, the last button depressed is still depressed.
	By default, REM has the setting defined in the general panel menu
	options.

	Note:	REM should be set to "no" only for bottom level palettes.

+++.3.2  Pocket Menu Button Declaration

The rest of the outline describes the buttons.  The graphics on a pocket menu
button can be either symbol graphics or text graphics.  The line defining a
pocket menu button with symbol graphics looks like:

	<command>, <symbol file>, <symbol #1>, <symbol #2> [, button options]

The line defining a pocket menu button with text graphics looks like:

	<command>, "<text string>", <font name>, <text size> [, button options]


+++.3.2.1  Pocket Menu Button Command

The <command> field is required both for buttons with symbol graphics and for
buttons with text graphics.  It specifies the command to activate when the
button is selected.  The syntax of <command> determines its interpretation.

o  If <command> is quoted, i.e. "place line segment", it is interpreted as a
   command string.

o  If <command> is not quoted, i.e. GRMPlcLnSeg, it is interpreted as a command
   key.


+++.3.2.2  Pocket Menu Symbol Button

In addition to the <command> field, the required fields for a pocket menu
button with symbol graphics are:

o  <symbol file>
	Specifies the symbol file containing symbols #1 and #2.  The length of
	the filename may not exceed 14 characters.

	If a symbol file is not specified, the symbol file specified in the
	general pocket menu options is used.  At least one of the two must be
	defined.

	Specifies the symbol that is displayed on a symbol button.  Valid
	symbol numbers are 0 to 255 inclusive.

+++.3.2.3  Pocket Menu Text Button

In addition to the <command> field, the required fields for a pocket menu
button with text graphics are:

o  "<text string>"
	Specifies the text string that is displayed on a text button.  The
	quotes define the button as a text button.

	To specify multiple lines of text, embed the `\n' characters between
	the lines in the text string, e.g. "First Line\nSecond Line".

o  <font name>
	Specifies the font for the text displayed on a text button.  The length
	of the font name may not exceed 14 characters.
