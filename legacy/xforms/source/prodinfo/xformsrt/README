  On Sun systems running Solaris 2.x and on SGI systems running IRIX
  5.x, there is a new method of arranging product installation structures.

  An environment variable called INGRHOME will hold the name of the
  directory that contains the DELTOOLS configuration files (the
  "ingrconfig" file that stores information about Intergraph products
  loaded on the system, stored answers for installation prompts, etc.)
  It is also the top-level of a directory structure that contains
  common bin, lib, man, and include directories for products that are
  loaded into that particular tree.  For a system that has multiple
  installation sets (for different product releases, etc.), the value
  of INGRHOME can be set to different values to create multiple product
  delivery trees.  For some application suites, INGRHOME may be set to a
  "path"-style variable to allow simultaneous access to several trees.
  In this case, DELTOOLS will use the first directory in the path as the
  location of the "main" configuration files during product installation.

  If the INGRHOME variable is not set, DELTOOLS defaults to a value of
  "/opt/ingr" on Solaris and to "/var/opt/ingr" on IRIX 5.x.

  The Intergraph Font Server must be installed on CLIPPER machines
  for fonts to work correctly.  This can be found under the

  XFORMSRT contains the XFORMS target shared library file, the
  required symbol files, and two XFORMS utilities, xgenmenu and
  xmrgpanel.

  XFORMSDP contains the form builder and other XFORMS utility programs,
  the XFORMS include files, as well as archive and host shared library
  files. A set of optional example programs is also available. These
  contain sample "C" source code, makefiles, and pre-constructed form
  and menu files, which demonstrate different features of I/XForms
  through small application-like programs.


  XFORMSRT automatically installs all necessary files to the user's
  machine.

  XFORMSDP automatically installs the form builder, XFORMS utility
  programs, the XFORMS include files, as well as archive and host
  shared library files to the user's machine. The user is advised of
  the space requirements for the optional examples and asked whether
  these files should be installed.  If the optional examples are chosen,
  they are delivered into several subdirectories in the "examples"
  directory under the product root directory.


  The installation can be tested by running any of the XFORMS examples
  as detailed below.


  The standard linkable libraries are built for the c100 processor-family
  ( such as an IP220 workstation ); there is also a set of libraries built
  for the c400 processors which provide better performance when linked
  in with applications running on these processors.  However, applications
  linked with a c400 library WILL NOT RUN on c100 or c300-processor
  machines.  Applications linked with the c100 archives will run on
  any Intergraph processor, but performance will be slower than
  if c300 or c400 libraries had been used.  The forms performance increase
  from running c300 rather than c100 images on c300 machines was not
  large enough to justify the continued production of separate c300
  images.


  Executable images for c300 CLIPPERS are no longer available.
  Executables for c100 CLIPPERS are installed by default on all
  c100 and c300 CLIPPER machines.  Executable images for c400 processors
  are installed by default on all c400 CLIPPERS. 

  Linkable libraries for c300 CLIPPERS are no longer available.
  Libraries for c100 machines are delivered by default to all
  CLIPPERS.  Linkable libraries for c400 CLIPPERS are also delivered
  by default to c400 CLIPPERS and as an option for c100 and c300
  CLIPPERS.

  In general, this product conforms to the CLIPPER library installation
  standard followed by the COMPILSUP product.  All linkable libraries
  are delivered in the xfi/lib/$PROC_TYPE directory under the product
  root directory.  They are not symbolically linked to the /usr/lib/X11
  directory.  The c100 archive library and the c100 host shared library
  are both symbolically linked to the /usr/lib and the /usr/lib/c100
  directories.  If the c400 libraries are delivered, they are symbolically
  linked to the /usr/lib/c400 directory.

  On CLIPPERS, the target shared library image is delivered to the
  xfi/lib/$PROC_TYPE directory under the product root.  The image
  which is correct for the processor type of the receiving machine
  is symbolically linked to the /usr/shlib directory.

  By default, sun4 libraries are delivered to all sparc machines.
  MIPS r2000A/r3000 libraries are delivered to all SGI machines.
  Shared libraries are NOW available for SGI machines.

  In order to link your application with the libXFI.so by using the
  -lXFI statement on the link line of your makefile on the SGI IRIX
  5.x machine, you theoretically must add the location of libXFI.so
  to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH shell variable.

  For example, say that INGRHOME is at /var/opt/ingr.  The XFORMSDP
  installation script will symbolically link libXFI.so to 
  /var/opt/ingr/lib.  So you need to:

	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/var/opt/ingr/lib

  before running makefiles that use the -lXFI statement to reference
  the libXFI.so shared library object.



  NOTICE!  NOTICE!  NOTICE!  NOTICE!  NOTICE!  NOTICE!  NOTICE!

  Version 02.00.02.42 will probably not be shared library compatible
  with the last released software.  Applications should relink.
  XFORMSDP and XFORMSRT have been recompiled in -ansi mode.

  ANSI prototype files will be compatible with currently released
  prototypes.  Applications which use only public interface functions
  (FI,MI,MS) will not be required to change existing source code in
  order to recompile.  Applications should not use private forms
  functions (_FI,_MI,_MS).

  In general, this product differs from the CLIPPER include file 
  installation standard followed by the COMPILSUP product.  No include
  files are symbolically linked to either the /usr/include
  or the /usr/include/X11 directory.  They are found in the include
  directory under the installed product root directory.
  Include files will no longer be symbolically linked to
  /usr/include/X11.  Applications will need to respond by either:
  A. Adding appropriate -I paths to makefiles
  - or -
  B. Symbolically linking the files to /usr/include/X11 manually.

  NOTE: Additional steps are required if you wish to continue using XFONTS.
  See the FONT MANAGEMENT section below for further details.

  NOTE: Many of the shell scripts used in the XFORMS and XFORMSRT
  products use ksh.  You will need to get a copy of ksh to run on the Sun
  to use most of the product scripts.

  NOTE: On SPARC machines, it is necessary to either run ldconfig or reboot
  the machine after XFORMSRT has been installed for the first time.

Getting Started
---------------
GENERAL

  In the following instructions and example command lines, several shell
  variables have been used for clarity.  You can either set these
  variables as needed for your particular machines, or type in the
  correct values wherever the variables are used.

  XFORMS_PROD => The directory on your machine which holds the
                   XFORMS-based application whose fonts you are
                   installing or removing.

  XFORMS_DIR => The directory into which you have installed the XFORMS
                   product.

  DISPLAY_NODE => The nodename of either a Clipper or a Sun machine to
                   act as a display server.  If this will be the Sun
                   machine where you loaded the products, this can be
                   set to 'unix'.


  RUNNING PROGRAMS BUILT ON XFORMS

  All programs built on libXFI are X clients.  This means that you
  must have your X server running before you can execute an XFORMS based
  program.  If your X server is not running when you try to run an XFORMS
  based program, you will the message:

    Cannot connect to X server

  will appear in the window where your error messages normally appear,
  usually the one in which you tried to run the program.  This message is
  written to stderr, so it may appear on the console window or not at
  all if error messages have been directed to /dev/null.  The action
  required at this point is to start the X server.  Check with your
  System Administrator for details on this process or refer to the
  documentation on how to start the X server.  ( Check the man pages
  under "X" and "X server" or the Chapter "Getting Started" in the
  "X Window System User's Guide", Volume 3 of the "X Window System
  Series" by O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.

  In addition, it is strongly recommended that a window manager be
  running to give users control over the size, location, color, and
  other attributes of their windows.  We strongly recommended that the 
  Motif window manager (mwm) be used.  Check with your system manager or
  the relevant documentation for details on starting and using a
  window manager on your machine.

  To run the XFORMS puzzle example:

    Start the X server.
    Start the window manager.

    cd $XFORMS_DIR/examples/puzzle

    csh:
      setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY_NODE:0.0
    ksh:
      export DISPLAY=$DISPLAY_NODE:0.0

  FONT MANAGEMENT

  Beginning with 7.0 CLIX, XFORMS, along with other Intergraph products,
  will be utilizing the new MIT fs process to handle fonts more
  quickly.  With the new paradigm, fs will be kicked off on the 
  fontserver node and will cache fonts, as they are loaded, for easier
  and quicker retrieval later (up to 10 times faster).

  To get the fs utility and the fonts that it can process, you must
  download the XWINDOWS product, which is a dependency for X-based
  products such as XFORMS anyway.  Downloading details can be found
  in the XWINDOW product.  The fs scenario runs with Intergraph's 
  7.0 software and XWINDOW release 5.

  XWINDOWS will set up the fontserver node and the automatic execution
  of fs during the downloading process.  To cause that setup to take
  effect, you must reboot before trying to run with it.  For more details
  on how to manually set this up, see the XWINDOW's product
  information.  

  To take full advantage of the speedier font performance with fs,
  be sure to load all fonts with the FS_NO_KERN flag and without
  FS_SHARED and FS_DEMAND.  The only exception is to use the
  FS_NO_KERN and FS_DEMAND flags for 16-bit fonts, such as Chinese or
  Japanese.

  SYMBOL (ICON) MANAGEMENT

  The X/FORMS library uses unconverted Environ V symbol files to
  display symbols.  Symbols, or icons, as they are sometimes called,
  are handled as Pixmaps in the X environment.  Pixmaps are managed
  by the Application Client.  This should allow applications to install
  their symbol files on centralized File Servers and avoid having to
  keep all of the remote Display Servers symbol files in sync with
  the latest Release.


  XFONT MANAGEMENT

  Since X server fonts are faster than Fontserver fonts when running
  applications across the network, we recommend that you
  add X fonts equivalent to Fontserver fonts to your display server
  or alias Fontserver fontnames to X fonts.

  IMPORTANT:  Those X fonts must not necessarily reside on the
  same machine as the application.

  Applications are still responsible for support and delivery of any
  custom fonts files which they require.


  GENERAL XFONTS INFORMATION

  X fonts need to be transportable across different systems from different
  vendors.  This is done by defining two types of formats for fonts, a
  Bitmap Distribution Format (usually abbreviated to BDF) and a Portable
  Compiled Font (usually abbreviated to PCF).  The BDF is an ASCII text
  file description of what each separate glyph in the font looks like,
  along with its size and positioning information.  These ASCII text files
  can easily be shipped from machine to machine.  BDF files usually
  have a ".bdf' extension.  BDF files must then be compiled on each
  machine into a format which is displayable by that machine.  These
  are the PCF font files.  Generally, the names of these compiled font
  files have a .pcf extension.

  NOTE:  XFORMS on the SUN will continue to use the resident SNF
  (Server Natural Format) fonts delivered on that platform.  

  Once fonts have been converted to PCF, they must be installed to
  make them known to the X server.  Under X11 Release 4, servers gain
  access to fonts by name.  The X server looks for font directory files
  to tell which file to access for a particular font.  By default, the
  X server looks in a well known set of default locations.  The list
  of locations to search for font directory files is called the
  Display Server's font search path.  Locations may be added to or
  removed from the font search path.  Finally, the X server must either
  be restarted or told to update its resource database with the new
  information.  When the Display Server needs a font, it looks through
  the font directory files in the current search path and takes the
  first match it finds.  If a match is not found, the font is not
  loaded and no glyphs from that font can be drawn.

  Unfortunately, the font search path reverts to the default set each
  time the server is started.  For this reason, we chose to install
  in one of the locations in server's default font path.


  CONVERTING XFONTS

  A utility called "evtobdf" has been written which converts current
  Intergraph EnvironV Raster format fonts into BDF fonts.  A copy of
  this utility has been included in the bin directory of this product.
  You should no longer need to use this utility, unless you are using 
  a customized font that your application delivers.

  The evtobdf provided with the forms product takes one or two
  arguments.  The first argument is the name of the EnvironV Raster
  font file to be converted.  If a second argument is provided, it is
  used as the name of the output file to be generated.  This name
  should end with the ".bdf" extension.  If only one argument is
  provided, the output will be written to the screen (stdout), and
  can be redirected to a file.

  It is our understanding that there are several versions of this
  utility currently available, and that each produce slightly
  different results.  We are working to resolve this problem.  For now,
  simply be advised that you may need to reconvert your fonts and
  possibly readjust your forms a few times in the near future.

  The "bdftopcf" utility is used to compile BDF fonts for the Clipper
  and the Silicon Graphics (SGI) MIPS platform.  
  This utility is generally found in the /usr/bin/X11 directory.  It
  is delivered through newprod as an optional part of The X Window System
  Runtime Product, XWINDOW (SS01096), under the Server Selections submenu.
  Briefly, the bdftopcf utility reads a BDF font from a specified file
  (or from standard input if no file is specified) and writes an PCF font
  to standard output.  This should be redirected to a file with the ".pcf"
  extension.  Complete instructions for this utility are available from
  the man pages.

  Font compilation on Sun Machines follows the same general outlines,
  but Sun uses different utilities to prepare their fonts.  Sun Server
  Natural Format is X11/NeWS format.  These files have a ".fb" extension
  and are compiled with the "convertfont" utility located under
  /usr/openwin/bin.  This utility converts fonts from one of several
  different input formats into one of several different output
  formats.  Its default behavior is to convert the input font into
  X11/NeWS format.  It takes the name of an input file as its argument.
  The -o switch is used to explicitly name the output files.  This
  prevents overwriting some of the newly compiled files in case the
  default computed names are identical.  The -n switch is used to ensure
  that the font names are what we expect.  Complete instructions are
  available for this utility from the man pages on the Sun under the
  /usr/openwin/man directory.  To find them, use the command

     man -M /usr/openwin/man convertfont

  A shell script called "bdf_to_fb.sh" was used to compile all of the
  fonts delivered to Suns by the XFORMS Products.  It is delivered
  in the bin directory of this product.  It may be copied and adapted to
  help with any font compilations required for your application.
  Again, you need not do this unless you are delivering a 
  customized font.

  Font compilation on SGI Machines follows the same general outlines,
  but SGI uses different utilities to prepare its fonts.  SGI uses
  Portable Compiled Fonts as its format.  These files have a ".pcf" 
  extension and are compiled with the "bdftopcf" utility located under
  /usr/bin/X11.  This utility converts fonts from one of several
  different input formats into one of several different output
  formats.  Its default behavior is to convert the input font into
  X11/NeWS format.  It takes the name of an input file as its argument.
  Complete instructions are available for this utility from the 
  man pages.  To find them, use the command

     man bdftopcf


  
  INSTALLING XFONTS

  XFORMS installs fonts by symbolically linking the new font files the
  installed font directory, rebuilding the font directory file there,
  and telling the Display Server to update its resource database.

  On Clippers, the delivered fonts are symbolically linked to the
  /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc directory.  The "mkfontdir" utility is then
  run in that directory to update the font directory file named
  fonts.dir.  The mkfontdir utility is generally found in the /usr/bin/X11
  directory.  It is delivered through newprod as an optional part of
  The X Window System Runtime Product, XWINDOW (SS01096), under the
  Server Selections submenu.  No arguments need to be provided to
  mkfontdir when it is run in the installed font directory.

  The last step is to tell the display server to update its resource
  database to find the new fonts.  This is done with the "xset" utility
  in the /usr/bin/X11 directory.  This utility is delivered through
  newprod as an optional part of The X Window System Runtime Product,
  XWINDOW (SS01096), under the Client Selections Administrative Tools
  submenu.  It should be used with the "fp rehash" parameter to force
  the Xserver to update its resource database.  The last step will
  be performed automatically if the display server is restarted.

  On Suns, the delivered fonts are symbolically linked to the
  /usr/openwin/lib/fonts directory.  The "bldfamily" utility is then run
  in that directory to update the font directory file named Families.list.
  The bldfamily utility is generally found in the /usr/openwin/bin
  directory.  No arguments need to be provided to bldfamily when it is
  run in the installed font directory.

  The last step is to tell the display server to update its resource
  database to find the new fonts.  This is done with the "xset" utility
  in the /usr/openwin/bin directory.  It should be used with the
  "fp rehash" parameter to force the Xserver to update its resource
  database.  The last step will be performed automatically if the
  display server is restarted.

  It is very important to avoid both font name and file name conflicts
  when preparing a product for delivery.  The Display Server uses the
  first match it finds for a font name.  This could result in incorrect
  symbols being displayed.  If font file names conflict, fonts could
  be inadvertently removed.  See the section below on Removing Fonts
  for some of the possible symptoms this situation can cause.

  This is the reason XFORMS font conversions on the Sun use the -o
  switch to explicitly name the output file.

  On SGI machines, use the mkfontdir utility and the xset command
  as described in the CLIPPER and SUN font installations above
  to set up your fonts in a recognizable font directory.

  A shell script called "inst_xfonts.sh" is used to install all of the
  fonts delivered to Clippers or Suns by the XFORMS Products.  It is
  delivered in the bin directory of this product.  It may be copied and
  adapted to help with any font installation required for your application.
  Most of the warnings about removing fonts apply here, too.

    cd $XFORMS_PROD/config/english/fonts

    $XFORMS_PROD/bin/inst_xfonts.sh


  NOTE:  If you are running on a Clipper machine, there is an additional
  step that is necessary to insure that Server fonts will be displayed
  correctly.  You need to edit the /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias
  and make sure that the following entries are there:

  REMOVING XFONTS

  If you have already installed XFORMS, you may wish to remove the
  old font files and reinstall the new ones.  Be sure to remove all
  of the XFORMS fonts, since the X server will only load the first
  match it finds.

           WARNING!! BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU DO THIS!!!

  It is strongly advised that you seek help from your System Manager
  before you attempt this.  If things go wrong, you could remove
  other fonts needed by your window manager and other applications.
  This could prevent you from opening any other windows or running
  any applications until you have reinstalled their fonts.

  Since this is an Alpha Release and you probably ARE the mythical
  System Manager, your best bet is to BE VERY CAREFUL.  Try to
  find a machine where you can practice this without doing too
  much damage and schedule it for when you have plenty of time
  and can concentrate on it.  It is strongly advised that you back
  up the fonts installed in the default font directory BEFORE you
  remove them.  On SUN, the directory used is /usr/openwin/lib/fonts.
  On CLIPPER, the directory used is /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc.  It is
  also strongly recommended that you use xlsfonts both before and after
  your first attempt so you can verify that you removed exactly the
  fonts and no more.

  XFORMS removes fonts by deleting the symbolic links we made to the
  installed font directory, rebuilding the font directory file there,
  and directing the Display Server to update its resource database.

  When a product removes fonts from one of the Display Server's
  default directories it is very important to take care to remove only
  fonts which that product installed.  Removing fonts delivered by other
  products can have disasterous effects.  For instance, removing fonts
  required by the Window Manager may prevent you from opening
  any more windows or from even starting Xdm successfully.

  This is one of the reasons XFORMS links rather than copies files
  from the delivered font directory to the installed font directory.
  We use the list of delivered font files to determine which files to
  remove.  In addition, if it turns out that other key applications
  were using those fonts, they can be easily reinstalled provided the
  contents of the delivered font directory have not been removed.

  A shell script called "rem_xfonts.sh" is used to remove all of the
  fonts delivered to Clippers or Suns by the XFORMS Products.  It is
  delivered in the bin directory of this product.  It may be copied and
  adapted to help with any font removal required for your application.
  You should look over this script and get an idea of what it does
  before you use it.  If you are not sure, try the process by hand
  with a single font first and confirm that it does the right thing.

    cd $XFORMS_PROD/config/english/fonts

    $XFORMS_PROD/bin/rem_xfonts.sh

  GENERAL CERTIFICATION INFORMATION

  User Interface Certification assures that all functions provided
  by this product are operational in the certified environment.
  Certification tests for this product are run in using an Intergraph
  IP220 running X concurrent with Env V as the X display server. The
  tests are duplicated using both MWM and TWM window managers. The
  client applications are run both locally and remote from a Sun
  SparcStation IPC. When testing in the local configuration, clients
  are executed both through command line keyins and through Looking Glass.


  CERTIFICATION CAVEATS

  1. For best results, it is recommended that this product be run under
     Motif Window Manager (mwm). Even though it will run with the Tab
     Window Manager (twm), the builder's forms do not display
     consistently at specified coordinates and often cover each other
     and parts of the menus.  Also the forms 'creep' down the screen
     with each iteration of display. Remember that the default window
     manager delivered with Xwindows is twm and that mwm must be
     delivered separately.

  2. This is not yet a production quality builder. Operation is slow,
     though features work and gadgets will place and edit. With patience,
     you can build usable forms.

  3. If you run this product in a mixed Environ V / Xwindows environment
     it is important to remember that the XForms based applications
     use Environ V mouse button mappings within the forms and menus,
     while all X window control is performed using the Window
     Manager's mouse button mappings. For example, if you are using mwm,
     the default for selecting a window (frame) uses button 1 or the
     left mouse button and selecting a gadget to manipulate uses
     button 2 or the middle mouse button.

  4. Running other Env V based applications simultaneously will cause
     display, refresh and color display problems in the builder.  These
     problems are NOT carried forward into runtime operation.

# Priority 3: HIGH    

[TR249305874]
    Direct calls to X routines are being made by XFORMS.
    This breaks journaling for Mechanical products, since we
    can't replay these events.

	We have added a new FLAG to override the X library XWindowEvent 
	function used in XFORMS.  That flag is FI_WINDOW_EVENT.  If you 
	choose not to override XWindowEvent, it will be called by default.

	/* override for XWindowEvent has same arguments as it does */
	int my_window_event_function(
		Display *display, 
		Window w,
		long event_mask,
		Xevent *rep;
	{
	  /* your code here */
	}

	main()
	{
	  int (*old_window_event)();
	
	  /* retrieve old window event function and set to override */
	  FI_get_graphic_env(FI_WINDOW_EVENT, &old_window_event_func);
	  FI_set_graphic_env(FI_WINDOW_EVENT, my_window_event_func);
	  .

	  /* reset to old window event function */
	  FI_set_graphic_env(FI_WINDOW_EVENT, old_window_event_func);

	We need an FIfld_get_notify_info() function so we can ascertain
	what event and gadget caused notification when we are in a
	field.

	If you call this function inside a field's or a multicolumn field's
	notification routine, it will check how the field was notified.  
	That allows the developer to determine whether to execute the    
	notification code, e.g., when the FI_CANCEL button is chosen.

    Mechanical would like an alternate method for drawing the
    bezels around forms, menus, & gadgets for both XFORMS and
    IFORMS on Clipper, Sun, & SGI.

	Added two new functions.  They have no arguments.

	void FI_use_thin_bezel()
	void FI_use_normal_bezel()

	These functions may be used to programmatically set the type of bezel
	display.

	The user can also alter the bezel display by setting and unsetting
	the THIN_BEZEL environment variable .

[NO CR]     A SUNOS5 (Solaris 2.x) variant of this product has been added.

[NO CR]     The SUNOS4 (SUN) variant of this product was built.

[NO CR]     The XFORMS Products have been repackaged to support platform-
            specific CD deliveries.  The products have a different product
            number for each platform.

[NO CR]     On Sun systems running Solaris 2.x, there is a new method of
            arranging product installation structures.
            
            An environment variable called INGRHOME will hold the name of
            the directory that contains the DELTOOLS configuration files
            (the "ingrconfig" file that stores information about
            Intergraph products loaded on the system, stored answers for
            installation prompts, etc.) It is also the top-level of a
            directory structure that contains common bin, lib, man, and
            include directories for products that are loaded into that
            particular tree.  For a system that has multiple installation
            sets (for different product releases, etc.), the value of
            INGRHOME can be set to different values to create multiple
            product delivery trees.  For some application suites,
            INGRHOME may be set to a "path"-style variable to allow
            simultaneous access to several trees. In this case, DELTOOLS
            will use the first directory in the path as the location of
            the "main" configuration files during product installation.
            
            If the INGRHOME variable is not set, DELTOOLS defaults to a
            value of "/opt/ingr".

[CR249202403]  Removed hardcoded pathnames for resources used on SUNOS5
               platforms. Added the function FI_get_ingr_root to get the
               first directory the INGRHOME variable so that XFORMS
               resources can be located at runtime.

               char *FI_get_ingr_root(char *ingr_root)

               Where ingr_root is a user-maintained buffer where the
               first directory the INGRHOME variable will be stored.
               If INGRHOME is not set, it defaults to '/opt/ingr' on
               SUNOS5 platforms and '/usr' on all other platforms,
               since the INGRHOME construct is only supported on
               SUNOS5. FI_get_ingr_root returns a pointer to the user's
               ingr_root buffer to simplify coding.

    Mechanical needs a function to set the color2 attribute
    of gadgets in both IFORMS and XFORMS.

	Two new functions allow the user to set the on and off colors
	of the second symbol on menu buttons.  They are

		int FIg_set_off_color2(Form form, int label, int off_color2);
		int FIg_set_on_color2(Form form, int label, int on_color2);

	Here's some sample code:

	    MS_enter();
		MS_init_menus ( );    

		FI_get_form_by_name("BAR_MENU", &mp);

		FIg_set_on_color2(mp, 11, FI_BLUE);
		FIg_set_off_color2(mp, 11, FI_GREEN);

	    MS_display_menus ( );

[TR249301600]
    Fontserver fonts from the X client are used even when X
    server fonts are available.

	Two new functions allow a programmer  to specify which fonts
	are preferred:  Fontserver fonts or X server fonts.  

	Those functions are 

		void FI_select_FS_fonts_first();
		void FI_select_X_fonts_first();

	These functions should be called before FI_enter(), since FI_enter
	sets up the preferred font strategy.

	Here's some sample code:

		FI_select_X_fonts_first();
		FI_enter (display, 
					DefaultColormap(display,DefaultScreen(display)) , 
					32);

	By default, Fontserver fonts will be used.

	See the Usage Notes for more information on how the user can 
	configure his environment to set up the preferred font
	selection.

  These functions are now OBSOLETE, and UNSUPPORTED. They are replaced
  by two new functions: FIf_get_Xscreen and FIf_set_Xscreen (see below).
  They will disappear in a future version of X/Forms.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

    int        logical_screen;  /* INPUT */
    int        absolute_screen; /* INPUT */

  The valid values of "logical_screen" are as follows
  ( #defines from FI.h ):

    FI_CURRENT_SCRN - Make the form appear on the screen where the mouse
                      cursor currently appears when the FIf_display
                      function is called.  The "absolute_screen"
                      argument is ignored for this case.

    FI_DEFAULT_SCRN - Make the form appear on the screen specified by the
                      "-display" option or the $DISPLAY shell variable.
                      The "absolute_screen" argument is ignored for this
                      case.

    FI_HARDCODED_SCRN - Make the form appear on the screen with the number
                      in the input variable "absolute_screen". Currently,
                      the values 0 through 7 are the only valid numbers
                      for this screen value.
                      BEWARE!  If you specify the screen number in this
                      manner, you must be sure that the X display
                      actually has that screen number available.

  Status returns:

    FI_SUCCESS
    FI_FORM_DISPLAYED - The form must not be displayed when this function
                      is called.
    FI_NO_WINDOWS_AVAIL - The X-server cannot allocate a new window for
                      the form.
    FI_ILLEGAL_VALUES - The "absolute_screen" was negative.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  int FIf_get_Xscreen ( form, logical_screen, absolute_screen )
    Form form;             /* INPUT  */
    int  *logical_screen;  /* OUTPUT */
    int  *absolute_screen; /* OUTPUT */

  The value of "*logical_screen" will be one of the following
  ( #defines from FI.h ):

    FI_CURRENT_SCRN - The form is supposed to appear on the screen where
                      the cursor currently resides.

    FI_DEFAULT_SCRN - The form is supposed to appear on the screen
                      specified by the "-display" option or the $DISPLAY
                      shell variable.

    FI_HARDCODED_SCRN - The form is supposed to appear on the screen with
                      the number returned in the variable 
                      "*absolute_screen". Currently, the values 0 through
                      7 are the only valid numbers for this screen value.

  The value returned in "*absolute_screen" will be the X-screen number
  where the form window currently resides.

  Status returns:

    FI_SUCCESS


  TR 92W1540 - FIXED
  Added two new functions, FI_set_SR_lockout and FI_get_save_restore_form.
  Applications which need Save/Restore forms to lock out the main
  application event loop should call FI_set_SR_lockout just after
  FI_enter.  Applications which do not lock out the main event loop,
  are responsible for making sure that FIf_process_point is not
  called for any form other than the currently displayed save/restore
  form.  The FI_get_save_restore form allows the application to
  determine if a save/restore form is being displayed.

  int FI_set_SR_lockout(void)

  This new function should be called just after FI_enter. It makes
  Save/Restore forms wait inside the FIf_display function until the
  form is erased or deleted.  Thus, the main application event loop
  will be bypassed during this time.

  Form FI_get_save_restore_form(void)

  This function will return the form pointer of the most recently
  displayed Save/Restore form. If no Save/Restore form is displayed,
  a NULL value will be returned.


==================================
Version 01.00.08.04 -- 01-APR-1992
==================================
  TR 92W1055 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem which caused Save/Restore forms to enter an
  endless loop when FIf_display is called. Added a global variable
  which tells FI_process_event to restrict event processing to the
  active Save/Restore window if there is one. Changed FI_msg_box,
  FI_msg_box2, FI_message_box, and FI_message_box2 so that they
  create Save/Restore forms. Also fixed a problem in xfb which caused 
  it to lock up when attempting to save a Save/Restore form.

  TR 92W0978 - FIXED
  Changed the way MS_swap_menu works in order to correct the
  situation where the BAR_MENU creeps down and to the right each time
  the BAR_MENU is swapped. This should make setting the
  positionIsFrame resource unneccessary.

==================================
Version 01.00.07.05 -- 20-MAR-1992
==================================
  TR 92W0988 - FIXED
  Changed the way color table slots are allocated by default on machines
  with fewer than 256 colors ( e.g. ROP machines ) since there are not
  enough unreserved colors left after mwm allocates its color table. Now
  XFORMS will allocate all 14 standard colors if the screen has 32 or more
  colors. If it has fewer than 32 colors, e.g., a ROP machine with two
  virtual screens, XFORMS condenses the standard 14 color requests it
  normally makes down to 5. These are BLACK, WHITE, LIGHT_GREY, DARK_GREY,
  and YELLOW. Requests to any of the other standard 14 colors will map to
  one of these supported colors instead. Applications which need additional
  colors on ROP machines should override the FI_translate_color function
  and may have to supply their own color map.

  TR 92W1220 - FIXED
  Added additional function overrides to FI_set_graphic_env. These are:
    FI_CHECK_IF_EVENT
    FI_MAP_RAISED
    FI_MAP_WINDOW
    FI_WITHDRAW_WINDOW
    FI_CONFIGURE_WINDOW
    FI_DESTROY_WINDOW
    FI_ICONIFY_WINDOW
    FI_UNMAP_WINDOW
    FI_QUERY_POINTER

==================================
Version 01.00.06.02 -- 05-MAR-1992
==================================
==================================
Version 01.00.05.00 -- 25-FEB-1992
==================================
  TR 92W0724 - FIXED
  Added FI_GRAB_POINTER and FI_UNGRAB_POINTER function overrides to
  FI_set_graphic_env.

==================================
Version 01.00.04.00 -- 14-FEB-1992
==================================
  NO CR
  Added new function pointer declarations to XFI_proto_pub.h

  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed declaration of FIf_look. Changed "FIform_obj" to "Form".

  NO TR - FIXED
  Added support for getenv() call.

==================================
Version 01.00.03.03 -- 05-FEB-1992
==================================
  No API changes were made for this Release.

==================================
Version 01.00.03.02 -- 31-JAN-1992
==================================
  NO TR - FIXED
  There is now a new file delivered with XFORMSDP called "XFI_link_all.o".
  It references all public XFORMS functions which are contained in
  "libXFI.a" ( or "libXFI.so.1.0" on the SUN ).  This new file should be
  linked into all applications which support the dynamic loading of other
  code which may reference XFORMS functions that the application's code
  doesn't reference.  Note that in the application's "makefile",
  "XFI_link_all.o" should be placed *BEFORE* "libXFI.a" or "libXFI_s.a" 
  or "libXFI.so.1.0".

  NO TR - FIXED
  Added new override functions to FI_set_graphic_env and
  FI_get_graphic_env. The new functions are:
    FI_MASK_EVENT
    FI_CHECK_MASK_EVENT
    FI_IF_EVENT
    FI_PUT_BACK_EVENT
    FI_SEND_EVENT

==================================
Version 01.00.02.04 -- 16-JAN-1992
==================================
o Added new function calls FI_set_select_button and
  FI_get_select_button. These two functions allow an application to
  specify or determine which mouse button will be used to activate
  gadgets such as fields or select states such as buttons. The default
  button for making selections is 2. An application may set it to
  either 1, 2, or 3 to make the left, middle, or right mouse button
  the XFORMS select button.

o Added two new functions FI_set_graphic env and FI_get_graphic_env to
  assist in journalling. These operate in a manner similar to the 
  FI_modify_env function. Two function overrides are presently 
  supported: FI_NEXT_EVENT and FI_CREATE_WINDOW. These are defined 
  in FEI.h. These functions will be called whenever XFORMS performs
  an XNextEvent or XCreateWindow respectively.

==================================
Version 01.00.02.00 -- 09-JAN-1992
==================================
o Updated delivered prototype files.

==================================
Version 01.00.01.02 -- 20-DEC-1991
==================================
o The XFORMS library name root has been changed to libXFI.
  On SPARC machines, the library is delivered as libXFI.so.1.0 and is
  symbolically linked into /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/lib. On CLIPPER
  machines, an archive library named libXFI.a is delivered and
  symbolically linked to /usr/lib/X11 for consistency. A host shared
  library named libXFI_a.a is now delivered and is also symbolically
  linked to /usr/lib/X11. The corresponding target shared library is
  linked to /usr/shlib/libXFI_s.  See the New Features section of this
  README file for more details.

  ***       Argument changes in FI_message_box()              ***
  ***************************************************************
  *** IMPORTANT! *** IMPORTANT! *** IMPORTANT! *** IMPORTANT! ***
  ***************************************************************

	   WAS:				NOW:

  float title_bodysize;	        double title_bodysize;
  float message_bodysize;	double message_bodysize;


  These changes are necessary to avoid the problem of non-ANSI C
  code calling the FI_message_box() function.  If the ANSI-ed X/Forms
  FI_message_box() function was expecting a float, and a non-ANSI C
  application code called FI_message_box() with float values, the
  non-ANSI C compiler would convert these arguments to doubles.  This
  would probably cause a core-dump in the ANSI-ed FI_message_box()
  function which expected a float value for these arguments.  Hence,
  these arguments have been changed to double to avoid this situation.

o Changed FI_msg_box() and FI_message_box() functions to not
  "warp" the mouse cursor to the form's window and not
  constrain the mouse cursor within the window's boundaries.  These
  functions also no longer "grab" the X-server.

o The obsolete function FIf_set_orig_coord() has been removed.  The
  function FIf_set_orig_size() should be used instead.  The calling
  arguments for these functions are the same, so if your code contains
  calls to FIf_set_orig_coord(), all you should need to do is change the
  function name on the call.

==================================
Version 01.00.00.00 -- 27-NOV-1991
==================================
o X fonts are no longer delivered with the XFORMS products.

o The product names have changed from XFORMS_S to XFORMSRT and from
  XFORMS to XFORMSDP.

o The installed location of FIsym and collapse.icon have changed from
  /usr/lib/xforms_s to /usr/lib/xformsrt. If your forms do not have
  the check and cross icons on the accept and cancel buttons, this is
  probably the reason.

o Functions which have been removed:
    extern int FIf_set_orig_coord(Form form, int xsize, int ysize);
    extern int FI_confirm_box(int screen, int xpos, int ypos, char *title,
      int title_color, char *title_font, double title_bodysize, char *message,
      int message_color, char *message_font, double message_bodysize,
      int display_mode, int presentation_mode, int line_length);

o New functions which have been added
    extern int FI_get_last_paint_area(int *xlo, int *ylo, int *xhi, int *yhi);
    extern int FI_set_auto_scaling_factors(double scale_factor_x,
      double scale_factor_y);
    extern int FI_get_auto_scaling_factors(double *scale_factor_x,
      double *scale_factor_y);
    extern int FI_msg_box2(char *title, int title_color, char *message,
      int message_color);
    extern int FI_message_box2(int screen, int xpos, int ypos, char *title,
      int title_color, char *title_font, double title_bodysize, char *message,
      int message_color, char *message_font, double message_bodysize,
      int display_mode, int line_length);
    extern int FI_get_form_path_length(int *form_path_length);

o Functions whose calling arguments have changed:
    was:
      extern int FIbtn_get_palette(Form form, int label, char *pal_name);
    is now:
      extern int FIbtn_get_palette(Form form, int label, char pal_name[]);

==================================
Version 00.01.00.01 -- 10-MAR-1991
==================================
o A great deal of effort has been made to minimize the impact of our
  transition from IFORMS to XFORMS.  The IFORMS public API has been
  preserved wherever possible.  Several changes were neccessary,
  however.  Here are some of the highlights:


  FI_enter - In IFORMS, this function had no parameters.  In XFORMS
     three parameters are required:

           FI_enter (display, cmap, cmap_size)
             Display display;
             Colormap cmap;
             int cmap_size;

     The display variable identifies the display server being used
     and is necessary for window creation.  You can obtain this
     value by calling:

           display = XOpenDisplay ("user_node:0.0");
                                    ^^^^^^^^^ your node name here.

     The colormap variables allow you to set up your own
     colormaps for your application.  If you will be satisfied
     with the default fixed 14 colors, you can specify NULL
     values for both cmap and cmap_size.

  FI_process_event - In IFORMS it had only one parameter.  This was
     an Environ V event mask that specified which event was
     pending.  In XFORMSRT, you must specify two parameters
     for this function.

     The first is a pointer to an XEvent structure.
     The second is a button transition state.  These
     values should correspond to the Environ V
     button transitions such as SINGLE_CLICK,
     DOUBLE_CLICK, etc.  If the event is not a button
     event, then send a value of zero.

  Routine                 Usage  Description
  -------                 -----  -----------
  FEI_calc_text           1.0    Uses X  "Font"  type  for  font id rather
                                 than int argument.

  FEI_draw_text           1.0    Uses X  "Font"  type  for  font id rather
                                 than int  argument;  and,  X  Window, not
                                 Environ V.

  FEI_find_font_id        1.0    Uses X  "Font"  type  for  font id rather
                                 than int argument.

  FEI_find_symbol_path_and_id
                          1.0    Uses X  "Font"  type  for  font id rather
                                 than int argument.

  FEI_font_available      1.0    Uses X  "Font"  type  for  font id rather
                                 than int argument.

  FEI_symbol_available    1.0    Uses X  "Font"  type  for  font id rather
                                 than int argument.

  FEI_translate_color     1.3    Uses and  returns  unsigned  longs rather
                                 than ints.

  FI_map_character        1.0    Takes XKeyEvent

  FIf_get_window          3.0    Pass in a  pointer  to  a X window struct
                                 rather  than  pointer  to  an  Environ  V
                                 window.


o Applications are required to link in the X libFS.a and call FSEnter
  before calling FI_enter. The parameters needed by FSEnter are:

         FSEnter (display, expansion)
         Display *display;
         int expansion;

  The display variable can be obtained from your XOpenDisplay call.  The
  expansion variable is not used at this time, so you may want to set it
  to 0.

o Applications must tell XFORMS where to locate these symbol files. The
  following IFORMS functions are now meaningful again in XFORMS:
    FI_set_symbol_path
    FI_append_symbol_path
    FI_get_symbol_path_length
    FI_get_symbol_path

  These functions are documented in the IFORMS Programmer's
  reference manual.

o The FIf_set_screen() function is currently stubbed out.

==================================
Version 01.02.06.03 -- 01-DEC-1994
==================================


  *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** 

  Beginning with version 01.02.05.01, all executables delivered 
  in the XFORMSDP bin directories are linked with the XFORMS archive
  library (libXFI.a) instead of the shared library (libXFI_s.a).
  This eliminates the need for XFORMSDP and XFORMSRT to have the
  same version number when running XFORMSDP utilities such as xfb.

  THIS RELEASE'S CLIPPER SHARED LIBRARY "libXFI_s" *IS NOT SHAREABLE
  COMPATIBLE* WITH THE PREVIOUS RELEASES OF X/FORMS.  APPLICATIONS SHOULD
  RE-LINK WITH THIS NEW SHARED LIBRARY.

  Fixes were put into this release of the shared library, however, which
  will probably guarantee that future versions of the shared library will
  always be compatible with this version.

  The XFORMSDP product is now dependent upon the I_LICENSE (SS01257)
  product.  If you do not have the I_LICENSE product on your workstation,
  you must newprod it and then reboot your workstation ( in order to
  start the I/License "psd" process.  An alternative to rebooting is to
  become super-user and type "/etc/init.d/psd start"  ).  If you do not
  have the "psd" process running, you will get the following error
  message when you try to run "xfb", "xmb", or any of the other programs
  delivered in XFORMSDP:

    Error: Policy Server (psd) is not running.

==================================
Version 01.02.06.03 -- 01-DEC-1994
==================================
o No new usage notes for this Release.

==================================
Version 01.02.06.02 -- 18-NOV-1994
==================================
[NO TR]
	The user no longer needs to set the FI_FONT_CHOICE shell variable
	to X in order for font text to be displayed on SMP-SCO or HP-UX
	machines.  That is now done automatically by the XFORMS code.

==================================
Version 01.02.06.01 -- 03-NOV-1994
==================================
o No new usage notes for this Release.

==================================
Version 01.02.06.00 -- 25-OCT-1994
==================================
[TR249406670]
    In a user field if several lines are left between text and the user
    tries to insert a new line between the text, all spaces/lines from
    the data point of insertion to the next character are deleted.

	With this version, placing text with FIfld_set_text() in a program
	will automatically create a paragraph marker on lines of text that
	are preceded by one or more blank lines (lines of length 1).

[TR249406896]
    When generating menus for 1024x768 resolution screens,
    Panel Menus are generated with an 830 pixel length.
    XGENMENU and GENMENU need to provide a means to control
    the size of a panel menu at menu build time.

	Now you can specify a panel menus height and width with command
	line options '-h' and '-w'.  Usage is described below.

        xgenmenu 
                [-v] 
                [-p <palette name prefix>] 
                [-h] <panel height>
                [-w] <panel width>
                <outline> 
                <menu file>

The height and width must be integers.

==================================
Version 01.02.05.01 -- 13-JUL-1994
==================================
[NO TR]
	In order to use the latest version of the FIfld_get_notify_info()
	function, you need to link with the archive library (libXFI.a)
	instead of the shared library (libXFI_s.a).  Only XFORMSDP will
	be delivered in the next PLOAD.

[TR249304524]
    Mechanical would like an alternate method for drawing the
    bezels around forms, menus, & gadgets for both XFORMS and
    IFORMS on Clipper, Sun, & SGI.

	The user can also alter the bezel display by setting and unsetting
	the THIN_BEZEL environment variable .

	To use thin bezels, you can

		$ export THIN_BEZEL=1

	To use normal bezels, you can leave THIN_BEZEL unset or do

		$ export THIN_BEZEL=

	The bezel display mode can also be set in a program.  See the API
	Changes section for that information.
	
==================================
Version 01.02.04.01 -- 22-OCT-1993

==================================
[NO CR]	The default INGRHOME location used by XFORMS on IRIX 5.x 
		is /var/opt/ingr.  On Solaris, it is /opt/ingr.

[TR 249301984]
	Add MI_set_tear_off_modify_routine() to allow programmers to customize
	attributes of tear-off menus.	

	We've added a function to accomplish this:

		void MI_set_tear_off_menu_modify_routine( void (*p_function)() );

	This can be used to set certain attributes of a tear-off menu that
	would otherwise not be accessible.  For example, you can set a 
	button intercept routine that allows you to trap the left button on 
	a tear-off menu and display a pocket menu, instead of doing nothing.

	Sample code that would do that:

    Fontserver fonts from the X client are used even when X
    server fonts are available.

	The user can now specify which fonts to use first:  X server fonts
	or Fontserver fonts.  The latter is the default.

	To set the environment to use X server fonts first, you must
	set a shell variable and export it.  Here's an example:

		$ FI_FONT_CHOICE=X
		$ export FI_FONT_CHOICE

	To set up Fontserver fonts as the preferred choice, do this:

		$ FI_FONT_CHOICE=FS

    Add -k switch to xPreviewForm to dismiss form immediately
    after it is displayed.  We need this for performance
    testing purposes.

	Running XFB on a 6040 with latest system software causes
	an EMT trap.  The problem here is that the display on this
	native X machine has been set to local:0.0.  If the display
	is set to nodename:0.0 or unix:0.0, xfb works fine.

	Be aware that setting the display to you local machine with
	local:0.0 may not work.  If so, set the display to unix:0.0 or
	nodename:0.0.

[TR249300372]
	Added the capability to manipulate/set buttons on menus before they
	are displayed.

	You can now specify a menu button creation routine that allows 
	you to set information about the button.  This is especially
	useful if you want to disable certain buttons on a panel menu
	depending on what sub-product you are currently in.  For example,
	a shading command that is valid in I/EMS could be disabled in
	I/MODEL.  This feature allows you to use the same menu (with less
	space and less menu design work required) in two distinct
	products.

	To do this, you must write a menu button creation routine and
	tell FORMS the name of that routine.  


	  int my_button_creation_routine(form, label)
	  Form form;		/* current menu */
	  int label;		/* current button */
	  {
	  	char buf[BUFSIZ];	/* name of palette or command for this
								button */
		int sts, attr_mask;

		*buf = NULL;

		/* get the palette name this button generates */
		sts = FIbtn_get_palette(form, label, buf);

		/* if no palette, get the command string/key for this button */
		if ((sts != FI_SUCCESS) || (*buf == NULL))
			sts = FIg_get_command(form, label, buf);

		/* If command string is "1987 do form 2441" and
			if in no-kids mode, disable button
		*/
		if (*buf)
		{
			FIg_get_attr(form, label, &attr_mask);
			if ( strcmp(buf, "1987 do form 2441") == 0 && !have_kids)
			{

    Save Form Builder Defaults doesn't save anything.  We need
    xfb.startup file for xfb defaults.

	A new utility called sxfb has been added to this version of 
	XFORMS.  This utility takes the output of the "Save Form Builder
	Defaults" command in xfb and creates a customized startup file.
	This new startup file can be used on the command line with
	xfb to allow the user to enter an xfb session with pre-selected
	xfb defaults, such as background color, line style, and line weight,
	without the need to set those up manually.

	sxfb is similar to the I/FORMS utility sfb, but sxfb does not have
	a graphical interface and it only sets the form parameters in
	the defaults files.  

	Before using sxfb, 
		1.	Get into xfb.
		2.	Choose the "Set Form Parameters" command on the bar or
			panel menu.  Set the desired parameters.  Accept the 
			parameters by choosing the check button.
		3.	Choose the "Manipulate Form" command on the panel menu.
			Then choose the "Save Form Builder Defaults" command on
			the next palette of buttons.  Fill in a directory
			and file name for your new defaults file.  Accept that
			by pushing the check button.

	To use sxfb,
		
		$ sxfb form_defaults_file [startup_file]
        		where
          		   form_defaults_file was saved from xfb
            		 startup_file to be generated (xfb.startup by default)

Version 01.02.03.03 -- 10-AUG-1993
==================================
[NO CR]     A SUNOS5 (Solaris 2.x) variant of this product has been added.

[NO CR]     The SUNOS4 (SUN) variant of this product was built.

[NO CR]     The XFORMS Products have been repackaged to support platform-
            specific CD deliveries.  The products have a different product
            number for each platform.

[NO CR]     On Sun systems running Solaris 2.x, there is a new method of
            arranging product installation structures.
            
            An environment variable called INGRHOME will hold the name of
            the directory that contains the DELTOOLS configuration files
            (the "ingrconfig" file that stores information about
            Intergraph products loaded on the system, stored answers for
            installation prompts, etc.) It is also the top-level of a
            directory structure that contains common bin, lib, man, and
            include directories for products that are loaded into that
            particular tree.  For a system that has multiple installation
            sets (for different product releases, etc.), the value of
            INGRHOME can be set to different values to create multiple
            product delivery trees.  For some application suites,
            INGRHOME may be set to a "path"-style variable to allow
            simultaneous access to several trees. In this case, DELTOOLS
            will use the first directory in the path as the location of
            the "main" configuration files during product installation.
            
            If the INGRHOME variable is not set, DELTOOLS defaults to a
            value of "/opt/ingr".

[CR249202403]  Removed hardcoded pathnames for resources used on SUNOS5
               platforms. Added the function FI_get_ingr_root to get the
               first directory the INGRHOME variable so that XFORMS
               resources can be located at runtime.

               char *FI_get_ingr_root(char *ingr_root)

               Where ingr_root is a user-maintained buffer where the
               first directory the INGRHOME variable will be stored.
               If INGRHOME is not set, it defaults to '/opt/ingr' on
               SUNOS5 platforms and '/usr' on all other platforms,
               since the INGRHOME construct is only supported on
               SUNOS5. FI_get_ingr_root returns a pointer to the user's
               ingr_root buffer to simplify coding.

==================================

o The version stamps in "libXFI_s" and "libXFI.a" have now been
  adjusted to support the new "INGR_sd_product_def" structure defined in
  the file "/usr/include/version.h".

o MS_swap_menu()
  This function has been changed so that it no longer deletes the
  menu that was swapped out.  If this is desired, then the programmer
  may first call MS_swap_menu ( ____, "none" ) in order to delete the
  existing menu.

o There are some new functions:

  FI_get_last_notification_type

      In a gadget's notification routine, the programmer can call
  FI_get_last_notification_type() and determine what triggered
  this gadget's notification routine.

    int FI_get_last_notification_type ( int * notify_type )

  The value of "notify_type" will be one of the following ( #defines from
  "FI.h" ):

    FI_COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION -  called from "regular"
            notification routine
    FI_INITIAL_NOTIFICATION -  called from initial
            notification routine
    FI_CALL_NOTIFICATION -    called from function
            FIg_call_notification_routine()

  int FI_get_form_menu_type ( Form form_menu, int * form_menu_type )

      The FI_get_form_menu_type() function will take a form or menu
  pointer as input, and then return the type of that particular form or
  menu.  The value of "form_menu_type" will be one of the following
  ( #defines from "FI.h" ):

    FI_FORM_TYPE      - The pointer is for a
              regular form.
    FI_BAR_MENU_TYPE    - The pointer is for the
              BAR MENU.
    FI_PANEL_MENU_TYPE    - The pointer is for the
              PANEL MENU.
    FI_POCKET_MENU_TYPE    - The pointer is for the
              POCKET MENU.
    FI_TEAR_OFF_BAR_MENU_TYPE  - The pointer is for a
              "tear off" BAR MENU.
    FI_TEAR_OFF_PANEL_MENU_TYPE  - The pointer is for a
              "tear off" PANEL MENU.

  FI_NO_SUCH_FORM

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

  int FI_get_num_forms_menus ( int * num_forms_menus )

      The FI_get_num_forms_menus function will put the number of
  "currently active" forms and menus into "num_forms_menus".  The
  definition of "currently active" is a form or menu that has been
  created with FIf_new(), MIm_new(), MS_init_menus(), etc., but not yet
  deleted with FIf_delete(), MS_delete_menus(), etc.

  Status returns:

  int FI_get_forms_menus ( Form forms_menus_array[],
         int *num_forms_menus )

      The FI_get_forms_menus function will fill the "forms_menus_array"
  with the pointers to all the "currently active" forms and menus.  The
  definition of "currently active" is a form or menu that has been
  created with FIf_new(), MIm_new(), MS_init_menus(), etc., but not yet
  deleted with FIf_delete(), MS_delete_menus(), etc.  It is assumed that
  the "forms_menus_array" has enough space allocated to it to hold all
  the form and menu pointers ( presumably, the programmer did a call to
  FI_get_num_forms_menus() to see how much space to allocate to this
  array ).  The number of form and menu pointers placed into the
  "forms_menus_array" is put into the "num_forms_menus" argument.

o Abstraction of text from X/Forms form files -  

        XFORMSDP now contains the "XFIf_get_text" and "XFIf_set_text"
  utility programs for extracting text and replacing text into X/Forms.
  These are basically "ported" over from the corresponding I/Forms
  utility programs.  Any text files created from or for the I/Forms
  "FIf_get_text" or "FIf_set_text" programs should work just fine with
  their new X/Forms counterpart programs.  Here is an introduction to
  their use.

      Most Intergraph applications currently use some sort of a "message"
  sub-system, whereby text strings are not hard-coded within the
  application executable image, but instead are contained in external
  "message source files".  These "message source files" are ASCII files
  which may be editted, either manually or through some automated
  process, and translated into other languages.  Thus, these applications
  will then display messages to the operator in the new language, without
  having to re-compile the application executable.

      Currently, X/Forms stores form information ( both graphical data,
  and literal text strings ) inside binary form files.  When an
  application runs, it calls the FIf_new() function, which reads the form
  binary file into memory.  The application then calls other X/Forms
  functions to manipulate and display the form.

      To edit these binary form files, the X/Forms "xfb" program must
  be run by a human operator.  As X/Forms exists today, in order to
  translate all the text on a form to another language, a human translator
  must copy the original (English) form, bring up the copied binary
  form file in "xfb", and then edit each gadget containing text by
  locating it with mouse button data points.

      This current form translation process has several drawbacks:

    *  The form cannot be translated by existing automated ASCII
       translation programs.

    *  The human translator must be proficient in both language
       translation and user-interface design.

    *  Undisplayed or hidden gadgets on the form may be unknowingly
       overlooked by the human translator.

    *  When a new version of the application is sent to the translator,
       there is no real way to tell which forms have been updated since
       the last version, and hence which forms need to be re-translated.
       The simplest comparison would be a date and checksum comparison
       between the applications previous form files and the new ones;
       however, if only a gadget's position were to change ( and not its
       text ) this would still indicate that the new form needed to be 
       translated ( when in fact it did not ).

      There is now new functionality in X/Forms whereby
  a form's text can be extracted from the binary file into an ASCII
  file ( presumably for translation ), and then re-introduced into the
  same ( or a copy of the ) form binary file.

      When the application's English forms are translated for the first
  time, the procedure would be as outlined below.  First, the new utility
  called "XFIf_get_text" should be run.  This produces an ASCII
  file containing the text for all the gadgets on the form, in a format
  outlined later in the document.  This ASCII file would then be
  copied, and the copies translated either automatically or manually
  into several different languages.  Then, the text in each translated
  text file would be inserted back into copies of the original binary
  form file with the "XFIf_set_text" utility.  This procedure, which
  could be controlled using shell scripts, is outlined below, with 
  a "sample command session" and a workflow diagram.

      For subsequent releases of the application, if the original
  English text file were archived for each form, then a simple "diff"
  command could be issued on the old English text file and the new one.
  If there were no differences, then that means that the text on this
  form has not been altered, so no re-translation is necessary.  However,
  if there are differences, then the form may be re-translated in
  its entirety, or else the old translation may be editted to incorporate
  the new changes.  Note that this methodology insulates the translators
  from reacting to cosmetic changes to the forms which do not affect the
  form's text.

                                          No difference:
                                             * No need to retranslate.
                                             * Translators keep same
                                               archived English form
                                               text file

            Differences:
                                             * Retranslate.
                                             * Archive new English
                                               form text file



      In summary, this proposed text "abstraction" functionality will
  alleviate the aforementioned hurdles to form language translation, in
  the following ways:

    *  The forms may now be translated by existing automated ASCII
       translation programs.

    *  The human translator must be proficient only in language
       translation and not in user-interface design.

    *  Undisplayed or hidden gadgets on the form might are always
       made available for translation.

    *  When a new version of the application is sent to the translator,
       there *IS* a way to tell if the form's text has changed since the
       last time the form was translated.


  Command Line Invocation:
  ------------------------

    XFIf_get_text [-f] form_name output_form_text_file
    -f                          Optional switch to limit the text
                                abstraction to fields and
                                multi-column fields only.
    form_name                   form file to be translated
    output_form_text_file       text abstracted from form file
                                ( input to "XFIf_set_text" ).

  XFIf_set_text form_name input_form_text_file [ translated_form_name ]
    form_name                   form file to be translated
    input_form_text_file        new text to put into form file
                                  ( output from "XFIf_get_text" ).
    translated_form_name        OPTIONAL:  pathname of translated form
                                  file; if not specified, original form
                                  is overwritten back into "form_name".


  Proposed Sample X/Forms Text File:
  ----------------------------------

  NOTES:

    * Comments begin with a '#' character in the first column

    * Each non-comment line is of the form "<keyword>=<value>".

    * Keywords in all uppercase letters indicate that the corresponding
      value *MAY NOT* be changed by the user/translator.

    * Keywords in all lowercase letters indicate that the corresponding
      value *MAY* be changed by the user/translator.

    * The file contains a version number, so that it will be readable
      by future versions of XFIf_set_text(), which may in the future
      recognize different keywords.

Version 01.00.02.00 -- 09-JAN-1992
==================================
==================================
Version 01.00.01.02 -- 20-DEC-1991
==================================
o Moved xgenmenu and xmrgpanel to XFORMSRT and removed them from
  XFORMSDP.

o Added Clipper X/Forms shared library -

  There is now a Clipper X/Forms shared library, libXFI_s.  To link
  it into your Clipper-based application, use the line:

	-lXFI_s -lX11_s -lXFS_s

  Note that the Clipper shared library has a dependency upon the SHARED
  library versions of libX11_s.a and libXFS_s.a.  This means that if you
  intend to use the non-shared versions of either libX11.a or libXFS.a,
  you cannot use libXFI_s.a; in this case, you must use libXFI.a.

  To use the regular Clipper X/Forms archive library ( libXFI.a ), use
  the line:

	-lXFI   -lX11_s -lXFS_s

o With the ability to run and display X-Forms on screens of varying
  sizes, it might behoove an application to adjust the size of its
  forms based on the size of the screen currently being used.  To
  this end, there are two new functions:

	int FI_set_auto_scaling_factors ( double scale_factor_x,
					  double scale_factor_y )

	int FI_get_auto_scaling_factors ( double * scale_factor_x,
					  double * scale_factor_y )

  By default, the "auto_scaling_factors" in the X- and Y- directions
  are set to 1.0 and 1.0.  If the application calls
  FI_set_auto_scaling_factors ( ), then these scale factors will be
  applied to all forms during the call to FIf_new().  For example,
  calling FI_set_auto_scaling_factors ( 0.6, 1.4 ) before any calls
  to FIf_new would make all forms be 60% of their original width and
  140% of their original height.  Both functions return FI_SUCCESS
  in most cases.  However, FI_set_auto_scaling_factors() will return
  FI_ILLEGAL_VALUES if a non-positive scaling factor is passed in as
  an input argument.

o There are now two additional functions:

	int FI_msg_box2 ( char * title, int title_color,
			  char * message, message_color )

	int FI_message_box2 ( int screen, int xpos, int	ypos,
			      char *title, int title_color,
			      char *title_font, double title_bodysize,
			      char *message, int message_color,
			      char *message_font,
			      double message_bodysize,
			      int display_mode, int line_length )

  Both functions have the same arguments and return values as the
  functions FI_msg_box() and FI_message_box().  They operate exactly
  like the functions FI_msg_box() and FI_message_box() except these
  new functions do not display a "check" box to dismiss the form.
  Instead, any keyboard button presses, or mouse button clicks
  anywhere on the screen will dismiss the message form.

o This function is carried over from the I/Forms environment, as was
  inadvertantly left out of the X/Forms library until now.

	int FI_get_form_path_length ( int * form_path_length )

  It returns FI_SUCCESS.

o Added new function, FI_get_last_paint_area().  This function is
  used to retrieve the last area of the form to be refreshed.  This
  function is typically called as part of a window event routine,
  where the window event type is FI_DISPLAY.  This allows the
  application programmer to restrict the refreshing of his graphics
  to the area returned by this function.

       FI_get_last_paint_area (xlo, ylo, xhi, yhi)
       int * xlo;
       int * ylo;
       int * xhi;
       int * yhi;

o Added the capability to re-load the symbol files in an XMB session.
  This is only an issue on CLIPPER machines that are able to edit
  symbol files via the sym program.  Formerly you would have to
  exit the xmb session to view symbols that had been changed while
  XMB was running.

==================================
Version 01.00.00.00 -- 27-NOV-1991
==================================
o Rebaselined. Build and packaging changes were made, but no new product
  features were included.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.13 -- 23-OCT-1991
==================================
o The Menu builder now has a new feature.  A new command line option
  has been added to allow you to specify a symbol file search path.
  This is implemented using the -p flag.  More than one directory can
  be specified if the directories are enclosed in double quotes and
  use the ':' character to separate the directory names within the string.

o The Menubuilder used to require you to hit a reset button before
  you could select another command with the middle button.  This was
  true in the cases where the menubuilder was waiting for the
  operator to select a gadget.  The Menubuilder has been changed
  so that you can select another command directly with the middle
  mouse button while in the gadget selection loop.

o Added functionality that would let you override the use of XFontserver
  fonts and go back to using X Server fonts.  This is accomplished
  by setting the FSfont search path to a directory that does not
  contain any ".tf" typeface files.  See New Functions section below
  for more details.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.12 -- 05-OCT-1991
==================================
o Reworked packaging and delivery to conform to new newprod
  requirementts.

o Added support for I/XFontserver fonts for XFORMS.  XFORMS will now look
  for I/XFontserver fonts before it looks for X fonts.  See FONT
  MANAGEMENT section above and API Changes section for further details.

o XFORMS now handles the loading of 16 bit fonts without the application
  having to override the FI_load_font, FI_draw_text, and FI_calc_text
  functions.  When XFORMS tries to load a typeface from
  /usr/ip32/resrc/fontserver/typeface, it checks to see if a charmap
  exists with the same name.  The charmaps are located in the
  /usr/ip32/resrc/fontserver/charmap directory.

  If a charmap exists with the same name as the typeface except that it has
  a ".cm" extension instead of a ".tf" extension, then the font will be
  considered a 16 bit font.  If no matching charmap is found then the dec.cm
  character map will be used and the font will be treated as an 8-bit font.

  If XFORMS cannot find the typeface in the fontserver default directory,
  then it will try to load the font as a .snf font.  If you wish to
  continue using .snf fonts then you still need to link in the
  I/XFontserver library, but delete all typefaces from the
  /usr/ip32/resrc/fontserver/typeface directory.

o Added new function, FI_inq_symbol_attr to allow the application to
  determine the size and offset of a symbol.

         FI_inq_symbol_attr (symbol_file, index, total_width, total_height,
                             xoff, yoff, sym_width, sym_height)
         char * symbol_file;
         int index;
         int * total_width;
         int * total_height;
         int * xoff;
         int * yoff;
         int * width;
         int * height;

  Status codes:

       FI_SUCCESS
       FI_INVALID_SYMBOL_FILE
       FI_INVALID_SYMBOL_INDEX

  Added new function, FIf_get_GC().  This function allows users to examine
  the GC settings in use for a form, such as clipboxes, etc.

       FIf_get_GC (form, my_GC)
       Form form;
       GC * my_GC;

  Status codes:

       FI_SUCCESS


=====================
Previous Enhancements
=====================
o I/XFontserver font paths

  FI_set_FSfont_path - As documented in I/FORMS.  This had been stubbed
    out before but is now used.  It tells where to find XFontserver
    typeface files.

  FI_set_charmap_path - Has one parameter.  A string parameter containing
    a list of directories separated by ':' characters.  It tells where
    to find XFontserver character maps.


o I/O Byte Swapping

  Early in our porting effort, we discovered that Sun machines store
  variables in the reverse byte order of Clippers.  As a result, form
  files written on one machine were not readable by software running
  on the other.  To correct this problem, we decided to maintain a single
  data format on all machines.  Data written or read on a Clipper will
  be treated as usual.  On Sun Stations, data will be byte-swapped as
  it read and as it is written out.  This way files will be readable
  regardless of the machine type used.

  The following data reading and writing functions are provided which
  perform the needed adjustments automatically.

  int status = FI_read_double (file, double_value)
    FILE * file;
    double * double_value;

  int status = FI_read_float (file, float_value)
    FILE * file;
    float * float_value;

  int status = FI_read_int (file, int_value)
    FILE * file;
    int * int_value;

  int status = FI_read_short (file, short_value)
    FILE * file;
    short * short_value;

  The status returned by each of the read functions is either FI_SUCCESS
  or FI_FORM_FILE_READ_ERROR.


  int status = FI_write_double (file, double_value)
    FILE * file;
    double double_value;

  int status = FI_write_float (file, float_value)
    FILE * file;
    float float_value;

  int status = FI_write_int (file, int_value)
    FILE * file;
    int int_value;

  int status = FI_write_short (file, short_value)
    FILE * file;
    short short_value;

  The status returned by each of the write functions is either FI_SUCCESS
  or FI_FORM_FILE_SAVE_ERROR.


o  Event Definition

  FI_get_transition - This function should be called by applications
    that need to be told about Environ V transition type events such
    as DOUBLE_CLICK, etc.

    To receive these you will need to replace the default FI_process_forms
    event handling function with your own event handling loop.

    Inside this loop, whenever a button press or button release event is
    encountered, this event structure is passed to the FI_get_transition
    function.  This function will wait for the operator to enter additional
    button presses and will then return the transition value.

    /*****************************************************************/
    /*                                                               */
    /*  Here is an example main event loop that handles transitions  */
    /*                                                               */
    /*****************************************************************/

    while (FI_forms_active ())
    {
      XNextEvent (display, &event);

      if ((event.type == ButtonRelease) || (event.type == ButtonPress))
      {
        FI_get_transition (&event, &trans);
      }

      if (! FI_process_event (&event, trans))
      {
         /* Do something here */
      }
    }


  USING ENVIRON V SYMBOL FILES IN X/FORMS

  The X/FORMS library now uses unconverted Environ V symbol files to
  display symbols in the X window environment.  Previous releases
  required the operator to convert Environ V symbol files to BDF format
  files, and then convert that file into a format that a particular
  server could read.

  Another bonus is that symbol files will now reside on the host
  system, instead of having to be installed on each server where the
  application will be run.


  ENVIRON V SYMBOL FILE SUPPORT IN X FORM BUILDER

  The X Form Builder now supports Environ V symbol files.  The
  operator can specify directories to search for symbol files in two
  ways.  The first way is to specify a list of directories in the
  :SYMPATH: keyword of the Builder's startup file.

  The second way is to key in a directory name on the Set Symbol
  Directory form.  This form is available when placing any gadgets
  that use symbols. (i.e. Place symbol, button, toggle, and checklist
  commands)

  When the Form builder session is over, it will "forget" the
  directories which were specified in this manner, so it would be a
  good idea to add them to your :SYMPATH: definition at this time.


  PREVIEWING FORMS

  A new executable called xPreviewForm has replaced the old FIf_preview
  executable.  This is basically the same program with a richer set of
  command line arguments which are more in keeping with new features
  required by X.

  The command line options are:

    Usage: xPreviewForm [options]
      Options:
       -d node:display.screen
       -f form name
       -h help; print this message
       -p form search path
       -s symbol file search path
       -z synchronize

  NOTES:
  1.  You must have the X server started before you attempt to view a
     form.
  2.  If you need to reset the symbol file search path to correctly
     view a form, then the new search path MUST have the required
     fonts directory file.  On CLIPPERs, this file is named fonts.dir.
     On Suns this is the Families.list file.  If this file is not present,
     the X server may not be able to load fonts correctly and other
     applications attempting to use the same server may be prevented
     from running at all.

  to not be delivered with the product.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Removed swapping of bytes from 16bit characters passed to
  Fontserver functions from FI_calc_text and _FI_16DrawText

  TR 92W1862 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem in xgenmenu which caused it to generate invalid
  menus. Changed FIf_set_screen call to FIf_set_Xscreen instead.
  
  NO TR - FIXED
  Changed the name of the formal parameter "class" to "window_class"
  for the FI_create_window function prototype to avoid conflicts
  with the "class" keyword when the XFIproto_pub.h file is used by 
  applications using C++. There should be no other impact.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed a problem which produced X error messages when an application
  attempted to use its own custom ColorMap.

  
==================================
Version 01.01.00.00 -- 22-APR-1992
==================================
  TR 92W1388 - FIXED
  TR 92W1417 - FIXED
  Added support for multiple logical screens. Several new functions
  were added and two existing functions are now obsolete.
  
  *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE ***

  When forms are saved with this release, the forms file format will
  change. Existing forms are Version 5, newly saved forms will be
  version 6, and can no longer be read by FORMS_S.

  *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** NOTICE *** 

  NOTE: Applications which override the FI_draw_text function should
  call the new function FI_get_form_by_window to determine which screen
  to draw to.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  int FI_get_form_by_window ( form )
    Form       form;            /* INPUT */

  Added this function so that applications which override the FI_draw_text
  function can determine which screen to draw to. It returns a form
  pointer if the window is a form, otherwise it returns NULL.  Once
  you have the form pointer, you can determine the screen number of
  the form by calling FIf_get_Xscreen.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  FIf_get_screen()
  FIf_set_screen()

  These functions are now OBSOLETE, and UNSUPPORTED. They are replaced
  by two new functions: FIf_get_Xscreen and FIf_set_Xscreen (see below).
  They will disappear in a future version of X/Forms.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  int FIf_set_Xscreen ( form, logical_screen, absolute_screen )
    Form       form;            /* INPUT */
    int        logical_screen;  /* INPUT */
    int        absolute_screen; /* INPUT */

  The valid values of "logical_screen" are as follows
  ( #defines from FI.h ):

    FI_CURRENT_SCRN - Make the form appear on the screen where the mouse
                      cursor currently appears when the FIf_display
                      function is called.  The "absolute_screen"
                      argument is ignored for this case.

    FI_DEFAULT_SCRN - Make the form appear on the screen specified by the
                      "-display" option or the $DISPLAY shell variable.
                      The "absolute_screen" argument is ignored for this
                      case.

    FI_HARDCODED_SCRN - Make the form appear on the screen with the number
                      in the input variable "absolute_screen". Currently,
                      the values 0 through 7 are the only valid numbers
                      for this screen value.
                      BEWARE!  If you specify the screen number in this
                      manner, you must be sure that the X display
                      actually has that screen number available.

  Status returns:

    FI_SUCCESS
    FI_FORM_DISPLAYED - The form must not be displayed when this function
                      is called.
    FI_NO_WINDOWS_AVAIL - The X-server cannot allocate a new window for
                      the form.
    FI_ILLEGAL_VALUES - The "absolute_screen" was negative.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  int FIf_get_Xscreen ( form, logical_screen, absolute_screen )
    Form form;             /* INPUT  */
    int  *logical_screen;  /* OUTPUT */
    int  *absolute_screen; /* OUTPUT */

  The value of "*logical_screen" will be one of the following
  ( #defines from FI.h ):

    FI_CURRENT_SCRN - The form is supposed to appear on the screen where
                      the cursor currently resides.

    FI_DEFAULT_SCRN - The form is supposed to appear on the screen
                      specified by the "-display" option or the $DISPLAY
                      shell variable.

    FI_HARDCODED_SCRN - The form is supposed to appear on the screen with
                      the number returned in the variable 
                      "*absolute_screen". Currently, the values 0 through
                      7 are the only valid numbers for this screen value.

  The value returned in "*absolute_screen" will be the X-screen number
  where the form window currently resides.

  Status returns:

    FI_SUCCESS


  TR 92W1549 - FIXED
  Added two new functions, FI_set_SR_lockout and FI_get_save_restore_form.
  Applications which need Save/Restore forms to lock out the main
  application event loop should call FI_set_SR_lockout just after
  FI_enter.  Applications which do not lock out the main event loop,
  are responsible for making sure that FIf_process_point is not
  called for any form other than the currently displayed save/restore
  form.  The FI_get_save_restore form allows the application to
  determine if a save/restore form is being displayed. 

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  int FI_set_SR_lockout(void)

  This new function should be called just after FI_enter. It makes
  Save/Restore forms wait inside the FIf_display function until the
  form is erased or deleted.  Thus, the main application event loop
  will be bypassed during this time.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Form FI_get_save_restore_form(void)

  This function will return the form pointer of the most recently
  displayed Save/Restore form. If no Save/Restore form is displayed,
  a NULL value will be returned.


==================================
Version 01.00.08.04 -- 01-APR-1992
==================================
  TR 92W1370 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem which caused the vertical scroll bar on an associated
  pop-up list to to remain disabled even when the field it is
  associated with is re-enabled.

  TR 92W1055 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem which caused Save/Restore forms to enter an
  endless loop when FIf_display is called. Added a global variable
  which tells FI_process_event to restrict event processing to the
  active Save/Restore window if there is one. Changed FI_msg_box,
  FI_msg_box2, FI_message_box, and FI_message_box2 so that they
  create Save/Restore forms. Also fixed a problem in xfb which caused 
  it to lock up when attempting to save a Save/Restore form.

  TR 92W0978 - FIXED
  Changed the way MS_swap_menu works in order to correct the
  situation where the BAR_MENU creeps down and to the right each time
  the BAR_MENU is swapped. This should make setting the
  positionIsFrame resource unneccessary.

  TR 92W1115 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem which caused text gadgets involved in data links
  to disappear when the gadget linked to it was manipulated.

  TR 92W1097 - FIXED
  Reworked makefiles for the examples to work as delivered both on
  SUN and CLIPPER. One result is that the examples now are compiled
  in ansi mode. The mail example was withdrawn from distribution
  until it can be made to work correctly on both SUN and CLIPPER.

  TR 92W0284 - FIXED
  TR 92W0758 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem with scroll bars, bezels, and dial gadgets which 
  caused gadgets contained within them to refresh incorrectly when
  they were uncovered.

==================================
Version 01.00.07.05 -- 20-MAR-1992
==================================
  TR 92W1292 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem which resulted in garbage strings being returned from
  FIfld_get_text under some circumstances.

  TR 92W0988 - FIXED
  Changed the way color table slots are allocated by default on machines
  with fewer than 256 colors ( e.g. ROP machines ) since there are not
  enough unreserved colors left after mwm allocates its color table. Now
  XFORMS will allocate all 14 standard colors if the screen has 32 or more
  colors. If it has fewer than 32 colors, e.g., a ROP machine with two
  virtual screens, XFORMS condenses the standard 14 color requests it
  normally makes down to 5. These are BLACK, WHITE, LIGHT_GREY, DARK_GREY,
  and YELLOW. Requests to any of the other standard 14 colors will map to
  one of these supported colors instead. Applications which need additional
  colors on ROP machines should override the FI_translate_color function
  and may have to supply their own color map.

  TR 92W1220 - FIXED
  Added additional function overrides to FI_set_graphic_env. These are:
    FI_CHECK_IF_EVENT
    FI_MAP_RAISED
    FI_MAP_WINDOW
    FI_WITHDRAW_WINDOW
    FI_CONFIGURE_WINDOW
    FI_DESTROY_WINDOW
    FI_ICONIFY_WINDOW
    FI_UNMAP_WINDOW
    FI_QUERY_POINTER

  NO TR - FIXED (May be EMS TR)
  Fixed occasional corruption of message fields reported by applications.
  Set the erase color with the ERASE_COLOR macro when message field 
  erase color is set to -1.

  TR 92W1055 - FIXED
  Changed the implementation of Save/Restore windows so that only
  gadgets in the active Save/Restore window can be manipulated while 
  it is active and retained their Save Under behavior. Save/Restore
  windows may be nested, but they may not be resized.
  NOTE: The window manager can still be used to move and resize other
  windows because these actions of the window manager are outside of
  application control.

==================================
Version 01.00.06.02 -- 05-MAR-1992
==================================
  TR 92W0201 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem which caused the puck to move to the end of the
  scrolling area, even if the operator had released the button, if
  FI_get_transition was being used in the application's main event
  loop.

  TR 92W0988 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem in EMS which caused colors to display incorrectly for
  EMS forms when a HELP window is activated and in the HELP window
  when EMS forms are activated.  Modified the colormap initialization
  algorithm in FI_enter. If a custom colormap has already been installed
  and a null colormap is passed in to FI_enter, then the custom colormap
  will be used instead of the default.

  TR 92W0808 - FIXED
  Corrected a problem in FI_message_box2 which caused an invalid
  icon message to appear on the system console.

==================================
Version 01.00.05.00 -- 25-FEB-1992
==================================
  TR 92W0722 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem with the way FS_TFPATH and FS_CMPATH were being
  set in FI_enter which prevented users from loading Fontserver fonts
  from the default directory. This was causing HELP initialization
  to fail in EMS.

==================================
Version 01.00.04.00 -- 14-FEB-1992
==================================
  TR 92W0366 - FIXED
  Changed the way XFORMS windows are created so that the Close
  Function on XFORMS Window Control Menus no longer kills the parent 
  application. If the form in the window has a Cancel Button, then
  XFORMS simulates the Cancel Button being pressed. Otherwise, the
  delete request is ignored.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed a problem in xfb which caused the grid subpoints to
  disappear and grid major points to display incorrectly when any
  non-solid lines were placed.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Adjusted the default locations of some of the forms in xfb.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Corrected double notification problem in MS_process_pocket().

  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed problem editing line gadgets. If the line had an X
  coordinate of 0, then the coordinates of the line being edited would
  not be displayed.

==================================
Version 01.00.03.03 -- 05-FEB-1992
==================================
  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed a problem editing line gadgets in xfb which caused the wrong
  line style and width to be shown on the characteristics subforms.

==================================
Version 01.00.03.02 -- 31-JAN-1992
==================================
  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed an XNextEvent call in _FI_confirm_box which had not been changed
  into an FI_next_event call and was causing problems for EXNUC's
  journaling.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed a problem in FI_load_font which produced an uninitialized tf
  string in some cases.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed a problem in the startkit example which resulted in an
  illegal instruction core dump on Suns.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Made numerous cosmetic changes to xfb forms so they look better,
  position themselves more conveniently, and take up less screen
  space.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed a problem with review only fields that had a single select and
  dismiss popup associated list returning two notifications instead of
  one when a selection was made.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed a problem with Line Style selection in xfb where it would
  always place solid lines even if you had selected a dotted or
  dashed pattern.

  TR 92W0096 - FIXED
  Fixed problem in xfb with moving embossed text gadgets in a fence.

  TR 92W0095 - FIXED
  Fixed a problem in refreshing italicized text which left small
  fragments of the original text unchanged after a single move.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Fixed a problem where zero addresses were being referenced as valid
  pointers in an internal X/Forms function call.  This problem would
  show up as a bus error when the user poked in a field which the
  programmer changed to use or not use an associated list.  Fixed a
  related problem in FIfld_set_attr() which would not un-set the
  attributes FI_POPUP_LIST, FI_ASSOC_LIST, FI_DISMISS_ON_SEL, or
  FI_VALIDATE_BY_LIST once they had been set.

  NO TR - FIXED
  COLLAPSING TEAR OFF MENUS -
  The MS_erase_menus() and MS_display_menus() functions need to be fixed
  so that they erase and display any tear-off menus that may be present.
  ***NOTE:***  These functions have been fixed to handle the tear off
  menus.  Also, the MS_delete_menus() will now delete tear off menus.

  NO TR - FIXED
  The FIf_delete() function has been partially fixed to delete an
  internal form structure which was previously not being deleted, thus
  causing slight memory fragmentation.

  NO TR - FIXED
  Need to know if user poked gadget or FIg_call_notification() was called.
  There needs to be a way to tell if a gadget's notification routine
  was called because the user poked the gadget, or because the
  application called FIg_call_notification_routine().
  ***NOTE***:  See the "New Features" section below for new
  functionality pertaining to this.

  NO TR - FIXED
  The ANSI-C include file "XFIproto_pub.h" now has the 
    #if defined(__cplusplus)
    extern "C" {
    #endif
  stuff at the beginning of the files.  It now also has the XFORMS
  "environment" function pointer declarations.

==================================
Version 01.00.02.04 -- 16-JAN-1992
==================================
o Removed the obsolete Draw Form checkbox on the Define Form Form. The 
  correct way to accomplish this task is either place a default size
  form and then dynamically stretch or shrink it, or place the form by
  precision keyin.

o Fixed a form problem which prevented the Toggle sizes from
  displaying correctly on the Place Toggle Form.

o Fixed double notification problem for fields with Single Select
  and Dismiss Associated Lists. Review mode fields were working
  properly, but all others were returning two notifications instead of
  one.

o Fixed the Fit Form Command in XFormBuilder to work properly when
  control buttons are present on a form.

o Fixed the problem with the XFormBuilder Grid Selection Form ignoring
  the 15/5 selection.

o Fixed a problem in XFormBuilder which sometimes left the Symbol
  Selection Form displayed after exiting the Edit Gadget Command.

o Fixed a problem in XFormBuilder which caused the same symbol index
  to be used for both the on and off symbol for a toggle when
  specified using the rotating arrow button on the Place Toggle Form.

==================================
Version 01.00.02.00 -- 09-JAN-1992
==================================
o Fixed problem with displaying the interior of a form.

o Corrected problem with erasing text gadgets particularly on older
  forms by using ERASE_COLOR macro.

o Fixed core dump in xgenmenu and xmrgpanel utilities on the Sun by
  adding required call to FSEnter.

o Updated delivered prototype files.

==================================
Version 01.00.01.02 -- 20-DEC-1991
==================================
o Changed dynamics color to prevent text gadgets from disappearing
  when selected.

o Fixed erase color problem with embossed or excised text.

o Fixed a problem where the application was core-dumping when the user
  poked a "review only" field's associated list icon ( which brings up
  the associated list ) and then poked the field proper instead of the
  list.

o Restored xmb to delivery.

o Fixed FIf_new() so that it won't core dump when creating the
  application's 29th form.

o Fixed slider and field gadgets so that they erase their right and
  bottom edges completely after these gadgets have been resized.
  Previously, there was an extra line of pixels to the bottom or right
  of these gadgets which was not erased during FIg_erase().

o Fixed the gadgets' "pass on to another gadget" code to not corrupt
  the gadget's "vertical scroll bar notification" attribute mask the
  gadget was passing or being passed data.

o Fixed FIfld_get_default_text() to not write one byte past the
  text array under some circumstances.

o Fixed FIfld_set_num_rows() and FIfld_set_list_num_rows() to not make
  the field or its associated list have a negative "row offset" when
  downsizing the number of rows in the field or the associated list.

o Fixed problem with an expose event generating two window_event_routine
  calls.  When an expose event happened through the initial display
  of a form, or an uncover event this phenomenon occurred.  One call
  gave a reason of FI_DISPLAY and the other a reason of FI_REFRESH.
  The call which generates the FI_REFRESH value has been removed.

o Changed XFB so that you can select a different command while XFB is
  waiting for you to select a gadget.  Previously it required you to
  hit the reset key before making another command selection.

o The review data link and review sequence commands have been restored
  to XFB.  They had previously been stubbed out.

o Changed FIfld_set_text to preserve an existing paragraph marker
  when overwriting a line of text in a wrap mode field.

o Added FI_get_form_path_length call to X/FORMS.  This function call
  apparently got dropped during the conversion from I/FORMS to X/FORMS.



  /****   NOTE   ****/

  There is also a fix that I was working on with Frank Ezell that
  it NOT in source control.  It is a different approach to the
  FIf_display wait-until-you-get-an-expose-event solution.  We figured
  that the SUN was blowing up because it was queueing up a bunch of
  mouse motion hint events that we were ignoring.  (We formerly looked
  exclusively for the expose event)  We were also going to set a time
  limit, so that you wouldn't sit and spin forever in case the server
  dropped the ball on the expose event.

  I think there may also be some sort of waiting occurring in
  FI_process_event.  I will have to look at this again since it was
  done BF   (Before Flu).

  I have not tested this on the SUN.  I do expect that Frank will
  be mad if the new release comes out and this fix is not in it.
  If we must release right away, go ahead but I need to try this out
  on the SUN sometime.

==================================
Version 01.00.00.00 -- 27-NOV-1991
==================================
o Rebaselined. No bugfixes included.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.15 -- 30-OCT-1991
==================================
o Fixed problem in XFB.  The fit command for button and toggle gadgets
  was not recognizing that a new font had been selected.

o Fixed problem in XFB.  During the gadget selection phase it was
  not allowing you to key in a gadget label.

o Fixed problem in FIf_set_screen function.  It had been generating
  a bad pixmap error.

o Fixed problem in XFB.  During the move gadget command, if a text
  gadget was being moved it would only partially be erased.

o Fixed problem in FIfld_set_num_vis_rows.  If this was called for
  a MCF gadget, it was only affecting the first column of the MCF.

o Fixed problem with disabling text gadget when XFontserver fonts
  were being used.  It had been leaving the bottom edge of the text undithered.

o Fixed problem with FIf_set_start_seq.  The start sequence was
  getting interrupted by the expose event for FIf_display, causing
  the sequencing to be aborted.

o Fixed problem in FIfld_set_default_text.  It was not updating the
  contents of the field until you called FIg_reset.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.14 -- 29-OCT-1991
==================================
o Product build scripts were modified to support the new SunC1.1
  compiler. No source code changes were made.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.13 -- 23-OCT-1991
==================================
o Fixed problem in FIf_paint_area.  This affected the clipping area
  of other forms other than where the paint area was taking place.
  An example of this was the Form Builder's message form field gadgets
  getting corrupted due to the clip area preventing the fill rectangle
  from fully erasing them.

o Restored all of the XFlush calls in the X/Forms library that were
  cut out.  It was thought at the time that they served no useful
  purpose so they were cut out to increase speed.  We have since
  recognized our error and put them back in.

o Fixed problem in XFB that was causing the SUN version to crash
  when you tried to edit a message field that had been created
  in that builder session.

o Fixed problem with form attributes.  The form was getting confused
  as to whether it was collapsed or displayed. The values returned by
  FIf_get_attr, FIf_is_collapsed, and FIf_is_displayed should return
  the proper values now.

o Fixed problem with setting the collapse icon for a form. Also fixed
  related problem with setting the collapse window's location.

o Fixed problem with the SUN version of X/Forms that was causing a
  memory fault under certain situations when a selection was made
  from a popup associated list.

o Fixed problem in XMB which prevented creating new subpalettes
  after saving the form.  A NULL string was being saved for
  non-palette buttons, causing XMB to think that a palette already
  existed and only needed to have its name changed.

o Corrected list of include files to be linked to /usr/include/X11
  during installation.

o Changed the list of files used to generate the XForms ANSI prototype
  include file, XFIproto_pub.h. Also corrected some function
  declarations to use the proper public datatypes.

o Fixed a problem with setting save/restore characteristics on a
  collapsed form.

o Fixed core dump on pocket menus when entering a left or right button.

o Replaced non-portable times based timer with a more portable
  select based timer.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.12 -- 05-OCT-1991
==================================
o Fixed bug in MS_init_menus that was causing a memory fault in freeing
  an existing collapse icon.
o Altered display of symbol gadgets to use the xoff and yoff settings
  that were defined for the symbol.
o Added support in XFB for specifying fontnames and bodysizes through
  keyins, rather than forcing the operator to make a selection from a list.
  The list that is permanently displayed now just lists available
  fontserver typefaces.  The bodysize field has an associated list
  that contains the standard bodysizes.
o Fixed problem with disabling and then enabling fields with popup
  associated lists.  Formerly the list was remaining disabled after
  the enable operation.  This has been corrected.
o Changed button_intercept_routine so that it does not subtract one
  from the button number.  The subtraction was being done to make the
  button look like an Environ V button.
o Fixed problem with Integer and Floating point fields that prevented
  entry of numeric characters. (ouch)
o Fixed problem in XFB field dynamics that was showing a larger field
  area than was eventually placed.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.11 -- 01-JUL-1991
==================================
o Compiled Clipper version with Apogee compiler.
o Removed "kludge-o-matic" install method for Sun variant.
  Sun variant is now deliverable through 6.0 DELTOOLS newprod.
  Several minor kludges were made so both variants can be managed
  with 5.0 DELTOOLS makenode and delivered to Clippers with 5.0 DELTOOLS
  newprod.
o Fixed double selection notification problem.
o Fixed problem with associated list on single line insert mode field.
o Added xgenmenu and xmrgpanel to delivery.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.10 -- 10-JUN-1991
==================================
o Replaced symbol font implementation of icon labels with Pixmap
  implementation.  This clears up the symbol scaling problem and
  restores symbol path functionality.

  NOTE: BAR_MENU buttons scale OK. PANEL_MENU buttons do not scale yet.

o XFORMS now uses the same symbol files used on Clipper for symbols
  on both Clipper and Sun. There should no longer be a need to
  convert application symbols into symbol fonts (i.e., into BDF
  files and then into SNF fonts). All custom application text fonts
  must still be converted, however.

o We will continue to deliver the symbol fonts for the time being
  for compatability with Alpha Releases 00.01.00.[00-09]. We will cease
  delivering them soon to help reduce our space requirements.

o Following the IFORMS example, we will install FIsym and collapse.icon
  in /usr/lib/xformsrt. We hope to find a more suitable location
  soon.  If your forms are missing their control bar symbols, check
  to see whether you have these symbol files installed.

o Symbols placed as symbol fonts on forms with an xfb in Alpha
  Releases 00.01.00.[00-09] will not be found if the symbol file name
  was specified without regard to capitalization. Symbol file
  specification is once again case sensitive.

o Fixed an installation problem which caused genmenu and mrgpanel to
  be overwritten in /usr/bin.  These utilities will be supplied in an
  upcoming release.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.09 -- 07-JUN-1991
==================================
XFORMS LIBRARY FIXES

o Updated evtobdf utility.
o Regenerated all BDF and SNF fonts.
o Removed "Best stipple" informational messages.
o Changed symbol positioning on regular display to ignore negative ascents.
o Changed symbol positioning after scaling to ignore x and y offsets.


FORM BUILDER FIXES

o Relinked xfb with libUMS.a library from UMS 00.01.00.03.
o Rebuilt FB.msg and FB.h with umscompile from UMS 00.01.00.03.


EXAMPLE PROGRAMS FIXES

o Modified "dynamic" example in xfb to reflect workaround for
  problem with displaying default text in dynamically created fields.


INSTALLATION FIXES

o Corrected problem with symbolic links in inst_xfonts.sh script.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.08 -- 03-JUN-1991
==================================
o Modified install.sh, share.sh, and remove.sh to run under /bin/sh.
o Relinked with libUMS.a library from UMS 00.01.00.02.
o Rebuilt FB.msg and FB.h with umscompile from UMS 00.01.00.02.
o Added "Unknown screen" message to FB.txt

==================================
Version 00.01.00.07 -- 31-MAY-1991
==================================
o NOTE: The XFORMS or XFORMS_S 00.01.00.05 and earlier installation
  overwrote IFORMS utilities and include files. The remove.sh scripts
  removed these same files.  This has been fixed. If you lost IFORMS
  files you should redeliver the IFORMS product. Sorry for the
  inconvenience.

o Known problems list added to README.
o Scrollbar buttons now work again.
o Examples code has been modified to fix several bugs which were
  noted and to support more of the X command line arguments.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.06 -- 31-MAY-1991
==================================
o Updated the README file.  Removed the README from config/english/fonts.
o Removed the tools.h file.
o Corrected several problems in the install and remove scripts.
o Reworked the font installation scheme and added to install script.
o Reworked the font removal scheme and added to remove script.
o Moved the font conversion utilities from config/english/fonts to bin.
o Replaced FIf_preview with xPreviewForm so that forms can be viewed.
  See New Functions section below for more details.
o Removed symbolic link of FI_link_all.o during installation since
  shared libraries are currently not supported.  When we do begin
  shared library support, the name of this file will change to
  XFI_link_all.o so that both platforms can coexist on a machine.
o Changed the name of the default FormBuilder startup file from
  fb.startup to xfb.startup so that both builders can coexist on a machine.
o Fixed a problem in the runtime library which caused stepper gadgets
  (two-button vertical scroll gadgets) to erase vertically all the way
  across the form.
o Fixed a problem with menus which caused a core dump the first time
  a button was selected which brought up a lower level manu palette.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.05 -- 28-APR-1991
==================================
o Delivered FI_read and FI_write routines which were left out of
  XFORMS_S 00.01.00.04.
o Added builder to XFORMS.
o Separated FI symbols from FB symbols and replaced in historic locations
  for now.  They will eventually move to a more X-like place: possibly
  config/english/bitmaps.
o Moved ev_snf to ev_snf.sh and modified accordingly.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.04 -- 25-APR-1991
==================================
The install and remove scripts have been reworked again to keep
up with the changing product contents.  Problems have been noted with
the remove.sh script in some situations.  These are being investigated
and will be fixed ASAP.  For now, caution is recommended when using
the remove scripts.

The Sun port is not yet completed.  Many problems have been
identified and fixed, but others remain and are being addressed.
Changes continue to be made as problems surface.

The XFIproto_pub.h file is regenerated for each release.  It should
alert you to applicable interface changes.  We will try to keep those
to a minimum, but retain the right to fix things as needed,
especially during this Alpha Test Phase.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.03 -- 10-APR-1991
==================================
The install and remove scripts have been reworked somewhat to keep
up with the changing product contents.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.02 -- 09-APR-1991
==================================
The Alpha 2 Release of I/XForms fixes a wide variety of problems in
the Alpha 1 Release and adds many features not available in IFORMS
when the XFORMS_S prototype was baselined.

I/XForms has once again been split into two products, a Runtime (XFORMS_S)
and a Builder (XFORMS).  Actual product numbers are not currently
available, and many of the things in product.def contain temporary
values strictly for testing.

  NOTICE! WARNING! NOTICE! WARNING! NOTICE! WARNING! NOTICE! WARNING!

The entire XFORMS product set is still being defined.  This means
there will be some significant changes in the contents of all XFORMS
products over the next several releases.  It is possible that names
of some of the elements may change as well.  Part of the intent is to
try to minimize the confusion between IFORMS and XFORMS.  We will attempt
to make changes as early as is practical so the platform can stabilize as
soon as possible.  Please bear with us.

==================================
Version 00.01.00.01 -- 10-MAR-1991
==================================
The Alpha 1 Release of I/XForms is the first newprodable version of
the Intergraph XWindows Based Forms System.

                WARNING! FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY!
                  Not to be used externally.

This is still Alpha test software at this stage.  This release is primarily
a test of the production and delivery system being used.

                Watch This Space for Further Developments!
