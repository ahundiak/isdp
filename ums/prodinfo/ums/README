  The UMS Product has been repackaged to support platform-specific
  CD deliveries.  The product has a different product number for
  each platform.

    Platform        Product Name    Product Number
    --------        ------------    --------------
    CLIX            UMS             SN0J256
    IRIX            UMS             SN0H256
    SUNOS           UMS             SN05256
    INTEL_SCO       UMS             SN0L256
    HPUX            UMS             SN0G256
    INTEL_SOLARIS   UMS             SN0S256


  On Sun systems running Solaris 2.x and on SGI systems running IRIX
  5.x, there is a new method of arranging product installation structures.

  An environment variable called INGRHOME will hold the name of the
  directory that contains the DELTOOLS configuration files (the
  "ingrconfig" file that stores information about Intergraph products
  loaded on the system, stored answers for installation prompts, etc.)
  It is also the top-level of a directory structure that contains
  common bin, lib, man, and include directories for products that are
  loaded into that particular tree.  For a system that has multiple
  installation sets (for different product releases, etc.), the value
  of INGRHOME can be set to different values to create multiple product
  delivery trees.  For some application suites, INGRHOME may be set to a
  "path"-style variable to allow simultaneous access to several trees.
  In this case, DELTOOLS will use the first directory in the path as the
  location of the "main" configuration files during product installation.

  If the INGRHOME variable is not set, DELTOOLS defaults to a value of
  "/opt/ingr" on Solaris and "/var/opt/ingr" on IRIX 5.x.



  NOTICE!  WARNING!  NOTICE!  WARNING!  NOTICE!  WARNING!  NOTICE!

  NOTE: Any Release of the UMS product lower than 02.01.00.00
  should be removed before installing this Release.  Beginning with
  Release 02.01.00.00, the include files will no longer be linked to the
  /usr/include directory.

  NOTICE!  WARNING!  NOTICE!  WARNING!  NOTICE!  WARNING!  NOTICE!


  NOTE: The User Message System included with the FORMS Product (SN**014)
  is based on an earlier version of that product than is used in the UMS
  Product (SN**256).  If the UMS product was not previously loaded, 
  then you probably need not download it.  If the UMS Product is loaded 
  on the machine along with FORMS, the UMS Product should be reinstalled 
  anytime the FORMS product is updated.  

  It is important that UMS be installed after FORMS.


  UMS contains the UMS User Message Compiler, the UMS include files, and
  the UMS archive library file.

  UMS automatically downloads all necessary files to the user's machine.

  The standard linkable libraries are built for the c100 processor-family
  ( such as an IP220 workstation ); there is also a set of libraries built
  for the c400 processors which provide better performance when linked
  in with applications running on these processors.  However, applications
  linked with a c400 library WILL NOT RUN on c100 or c300-processor
  machines.  Applications linked with the c100 archives will run on
  any Intergraph processor, but performance will be slower than
  if c300 or c400 libraries had been used.  The forms performance increase
  from running c300 rather than c100 images on c300 machines was not
  large enough to justify the continued production of separate c300
  images.

  Executable images for c300 CLIPPERS are no longer available.
  Executables for c100 CLIPPERS are installed by default on all
  c100 and c300 CLIPPER machines.  Executable images for c400 processors
  are installed by default on all c400 CLIPPERS. 

  Linkable libraries for c300 CLIPPERS are no longer available.
  Libraries for c100 machines are delivered by default to all
  CLIPPERS.  Linkable libraries for c400 CLIPPERS are also delivered
  by default to c400 CLIPPERS and as an option for c100 and c300
  CLIPPERS.

  In general, this product conforms to the CLIPPER library installation
  standard followed by the COMPILSUP product.  All linkable libraries
  are delivered in the xfi/lib/$PROC_TYPE directory under the product
  root directory.  They are not symbolically linked to the /usr/lib/X11
  directory.  The c100 archive library and the c100 host shared library
  are both symbolically linked to the /usr/lib and the /usr/lib/c100
  directories.  If the c400 libraries are delivered, they are symbolically
  linked to the /usr/lib/c400 directory.

  On CLIPPERS, the target shared library image is delivered to the
  xfi/lib/$PROC_TYPE directory under the product root.  The image
  which is correct for the processor type of the receiving machine
  is symbolically linked to the /usr/shlib directory.

  By default, sun4 libraries are delivered to all sparc machines.

  MIPS r2000A/r3000 libraries are delivered to all SGI machines.
  Shared libraries are not available for SGI machines.


  In general, this product differs from the CLIPPER include file 
  installation standard followed by the COMPILSUP product.  No include
  files are symbolically linked to either the /usr/include
  or the /usr/include/X11 directory.  They are found in the include
  directory under the installed product root directory.

[NO CR]     Stop symbolically linking the UMS include files from the
            include directory under the installed product to the
            /usr/include directory.  Applications must either modify
            their makefiles to use the include files under the product
            delivery directory or manually link them to the /usr/include
            directory.

==================================
  NO CR - FIXED
  Changed from using undelivered prototype file internally to using
  the delivered public prototype file, pums_pub.h to provide a better
  cross check that the delivered prototypes are correct. Also
  changed source to use ansi syntax function declarations instead of
  knr syntax so that prototypes will actually be checked.

  NO CR - FIXED
  Changed from using prototypes generated from the source code to
  using manually maintained prototypes.

  NO CR - FIXED
  Added support for multiple processor types. Executable images for only
  the native processor type are delivered. By default, sun4 libraries
  are delivered to all sparc machines and either c100, c300, or c400
  libraries to clipper machines, depending on the native processor type.
  On clipper machines, libraries built for these other processor types
  are available as options. All libraries are delivered in the
  lib/$PROC_TYPE directory under the product root directory and
  symbolically linked to the /usr/lib/$PROC_TYPE directory. The library
  for the native processor type is linked to the /usr/lib directory.
  Include files are delivered into the include directory under the
  product root directory and symbolically linked to the /usr/include
  directory. Applications on clipper platforms which need to
  build non-native images will need to use either the -Atarg switch
  on acc or the -L switch for ld, depending on the details of their
  makefiles.

Version 02.00.00.00 -- 28-OCT-1991
==================================

NOTICE! NOTICE! NOTICE! NOTICE! NOTICE! NOTICE! NOTICE! NOTICE! NOTICE! 

o Starting with this release, the names of several parts of the
  public interface for UMS have changed to accomodate developers 
  in a DOS environment. Most of these name changes are in response to 
  the shorter filename and case insensitivity limitations of DOS.
  These may very well change soon to conform more closely to the newly
  advertised Intergraph Library Standards. We will try to keep these
  changes to a minimum, but reserve the right to correct them as
  neccessary.

  All applications which build on UMS must react by changing any 
  references in source code and/or makefiles from the old names to
  the new ones before recompiling.

  The name of the UMS library is changed from libUMS.a to libums.a. 
  The name of the UMS prototype file is changed from UMSproto_pub.h 
  to pums_pub.sh.
  The UMS compiler is delivered as umscomp. It is then symbolically
  linked to /usr/bin as umscomp, umscompile, umcmptxt, and
  umscomptxt. This should accomodate both existing and new UMS users
  on CLIPPERs, SPARCs, and PCs.  
  The names of the UMS include files have not changed.

New Features
------------
==================================
Version 02.01.06.00 -- 29-NOV-1994
==================================
[NO CR]
	Ported UMS to INTEL_SOLARIS platform.

==================================
Version 02.01.05.01 -- 09-NOV-1994
==================================
[NO CR]
	Ported UMS to SMP SCO 3.2 and HP-UX A.09.03.

==================================
Version 02.01.05.00 -- 24-OCT-1994
==================================
[CR249301405] (RESOLVED, INSUFFICIENT WORKSHEETS)
	Exnuc needs _UMS_returnbynum and _UMS_returnbypointer to
	be added to the public UMS interface.

==================================
Version 02.01.04.00 -- 13-OCT-1993
==================================
[NO CR]	Added INGRHOME strategy to IRIX 5.x UMS.

==================================
Version 02.01.03.04 -- 19-AUG-1993
==================================
[NO CR] This version works on CLIX, SUNOS 4.1.2, SUNOS 4.1.3, Solaris,
		MIPS IRIX 4.0.5, MIPS IRIX 5.1, and AST 400 SCO-UNIX 3.2.

==================================
Version 02.01.03.03 -- 12-AUG-1993
==================================
o No new features were added in this Release.

==================================
Version 02.01.03.00 -- 04-AUG-1993
==================================
o No new features were added in this Release.

==================================
Version 02.01.02.00 -- 14-JUL-1993
==================================
[NO CR]     A SUNOS5 (Solaris 2.x) variant of this product has been added.

[NO CR]     The SUNOS4 (SUN) variant of this product was built.

[NO CR]     The UMS Product has been repackaged to support platform-
            specific CD deliveries.  The product has a different product
            number for each platform.

[NO CR]     On Sun systems running Solaris 2.x, there is a new method of
            arranging product installation structures.
            
            An environment variable called INGRHOME will hold the name of
            the directory that contains the DELTOOLS configuration files
            (the "ingrconfig" file that stores information about
            Intergraph products loaded on the system, stored answers for
            installation prompts, etc.) It is also the top-level of a
            directory structure that contains common bin, lib, man, and
            include directories for products that are loaded into that
            particular tree.  For a system that has multiple installation
            sets (for different product releases, etc.), the value of
            INGRHOME can be set to different values to create multiple
            product delivery trees.  For some application suites,
            INGRHOME may be set to a "path"-style variable to allow
            simultaneous access to several trees. In this case, DELTOOLS
            will use the first directory in the path as the location of
            the "main" configuration files during product installation.
            
            If the INGRHOME variable is not set, DELTOOLS defaults to a
            value of "/opt/ingr".

==================================
Version 02.01.01.02 -- 25-MAY-1993
==================================
o No new features were added in this Release.
  A MIPS (SGI) variant of this product has been added.

==================================
Version 02.01.01.01 -- 19-MAR-1993

==================================
Version 02.01.01.00 -- 19-FEB-1993
==================================
o No new features were added in this Release.
  A MIPS (SGI) variant of this product has been added.

==================================
Version 02.01.00.04 -- 28-JAN-1993
==================================
# Priority 3: HIGH    

[CR249202557]
    Changed the product build procedure to utilize makemake.


==================================
Version 02.01.00.02 -- 05-JAN-1993
==================================
# Priority 2: CRITICAL

[CR92W2557] Changed the product build procedure to utitilize makemake.

# Priority 4: NORMAL

[NO CR]     Stop symbolically linking the UMS include files from the
            include directory under the installed product to the
            /usr/include directory.  Applications must either modify
            their makefiles to use the include files under the product
            delivery directory or manually link them to the /usr/include
            directory.
[NO CR]     Stop delivering C300 linkable libraries and executables. 
            C100 images should be used on C100 and C300 CLIX machines.
[NO CR]     Add support for MIPS (SGI) machines.

==================================
Version 02.00.02.04 -- 15-JUL-1992
==================================
o No new features were added in this Release.

==================================
Version 02.00.02.03 -- 07-JUL-1992
==================================
  NO CR - FIXED
  Changed from using undelivered prototype file internally to using
  the delivered public prototype file, pums_pub.h to provide a better
  cross check that the delivered prototypes are correct. Also
  changed source to use ansi syntax function declarations instead of
  knr syntax so that prototypes will actually be checked.

  NO CR - FIXED
  Changed from using prototypes generated from the source code to
  using manually maintained prototypes.

  NO CR - FIXED
  Added support for multiple processor types. Executable images for only
  the native processor type are delivered. By default, sun4 libraries
  are delivered to all sparc machines and either c100, c300, or c400
  libraries to clipper machines, depending on the native processor type.
  On clipper machines, libraries built for these other processor types
  are available as options. All libraries are delivered in the
  lib/$PROC_TYPE directory under the product root directory and
  symbolically linked to the /usr/lib/$PROC_TYPE directory. The library
  for the native processor type is linked to the /usr/lib directory.
  Include files are delivered into the include directory under the
  product root directory and symbolically linked to the /usr/include
  directory. Applications on clipper platforms which need to
  build non-native images will need to use either the -Atarg switch
  on acc or the -L switch for ld, depending on the details of their
  makefiles.

New Fixes
---------
==================================
Version 02.01.06.00 -- 29-NOV-1994
==================================
# Priority 4: NORMAL  

[TR249404619] (FIXED)
	UMS function UMSGetByNum kills process linked with UMS API library
	with a signal 11 when asked to return a message that is long but
	considerably shorter than UMS_MAX_BUFLEN.
[TR249302795] (WORKS AS DESIGNED)
	If format = %s and arg=0 ums crashes on solaris works ok on CLIX.

	Application programmers should use "", not 0, as the argument when
	the format specifier is %s.  This is similar to the behavior of the
	C standard library function printf().

[TR249400070] (CANNOT REPRODUCE)
    When an embedded RIS program is compiled using -Bstatic
    switch, the program will fail.

# Priority 4: NORMAL  

[TR249303531] (FIXED)
    Text with no variable can not exceed 499 chars without compiler
    error. Textwith one variable can not exceed 355 chars without
    core dump and printing only up to 308 chars.
[TR249302397] (FIXED)
    Parentheses in the parameter (PDISO_E_1 = 14084106) statement
    of the generated Fortran include file make the PDISO_E_1 a real
    number not an integer.
[TR249203016] (NOT A UMS PROBLEM)
    Messages which are too long for the MS message field will not
    display, but UMS returns a successful status anyway.
